<h1>Good fences make good neighbours</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence0.jpg" src="../../../_images/fence0.jpg" />
<p>The EEC was not very popular when the government took the UK into it in
1973 and so the government was forced by the voters to have its first
leaving referendum only two years later in 1975.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence1.jpg" src="../../../_images/fence1.jpg" />
<p>The government and all of the media threw the kitchen sink at remain in
and succeeded, but on practical grounds alone, it never even tried to
sell the vision of an ever closer union to the people of Britain, and
if it had, it would have been rejected.</p>
<p>While governments managed to resist another referendum for the next
four decades, the practical nature of the remain argument meant there
was no mandate for further integration, indeed the remain argument was
won precisely on the basis that Britain would not be pulled in any
deeper.</p>
<p>So as the EU project developed in different directions, Europe was not
something Britain did, Europe was something done to it; something that
had to resisted or opted-out of: Schengen Area, the Eurozone and
countless other programmes.</p>
<p>The 2016 EU referendum was the the last moment in history that a
pro-EU case could be credibly made but again the establishment decided
not to make it. It again decided to focus on the perceived practical
shortcomings of an independent UK.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence2.jpg" src="../../../_images/fence2.jpg" />
<p>In other countries, there are some people who genuinely believe in a
United States of Europe. However, <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">we in the UK never had that
tradition</a>, so those arguing for remain are those who benefit most
from the patronage that results from laundering our own taxes to and
from Brussels give.</p>
<p>Brussels is awash with lobbyists for non-European interests and
yesterdays winners struggling with technological change, wanting to
game the regulations against new interests.</p>
<p>Remain was a coalition between decent people wanting to keep the
status quo but also all these aforementioned parasites and spivs who
know they could not justify a policy or an item of government spending
to the British electorate so abuse the (still not very democratic) EU
to sidestep democracy to push their own special interests and
regulations.</p>
<p>I <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">said before the referendum</a> that the rationale for entering the EU
in 1973 was marginal at best and I concluded the forces moving the UK
away from it <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html#enter-the-matrix">were increasing</a>.</p>
<p>The neo-liberal/Thacherite consensus of the last 30 years cracked
fatally in the 2008 crash, since then it has been on life support as
near infinite supplies of money are printed and dished out to the
banks, but brain activity has not returned to the patient. The EU
referendum is the British people starting to turn the machine off.</p>
<p>To put it another way, as I said <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/750044741073592320">on Twitter</a>, it was Chekhov&#8217;s
referendum. David Cameron put a gun on stage and the people shot him
with it.</p>
<p>After the vote, I talked about the call for the second referendum and
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#second-referendum">why it will not work</a>, Brexit has just sped up the inevitable
changes.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence3.jpg" src="../../../_images/fence3.jpg" />
<p>Anyway Britain is leaving the EU. If you voted for remain, not only
will be much happier if you just accept it and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/750323410979397632">move on with your life</a>,
you will be more successful. Escaping to a fantasyland where the vote
did not happen will mean you miss the opportunities of the future.</p>
<p>This applies to organisations and sections of the economy too, after
all no one is owed a living.</p>
<p>Those that work in harmony with the new independent era will thrive,
those that mope around re-fighting yesterday&#8217;s narrative will be seen
as irrelevant in the post-Brexit era and thus will lose funding
accordingly.</p>
<p>The leave supporting public has been gracious in victory, trying to
bring everyone on board. However, the good mood will not last long if
institutions are seen to be working against the UK. David Cameron and
George Osborne doubled-down on Remain and their position was untenable
in the new era. Those that don&#8217;t learn the lesson might suffer the
same fate.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence4.jpg" src="../../../_images/fence4.jpg" />
<p>I think in the long term, Brexit will be a benefit to all of Europe,
Britain has gone from being an unhappy tenant of the EU to Europe&#8217;s
most supportive neighbour and ally.</p>
<p>If you are a European, we the British people, voted to take by control
and run our country from Westminster and our city councils and
regional parliaments in the UK. However, we still love you as people
and we love your countries. We can still kiss you from over the fence.</p>
