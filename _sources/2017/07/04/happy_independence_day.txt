Happy Independence Day America
==============================

People talk about the UK becoming an independent country
again. However, normally we have been on the other side of the table,
the first time being when the United States of America left the
British Empire.

As regular readers will know, I like to view history as a history of
technology, and of course being over two centuries apart, American
Independence and Brexit are using very different technologies.

The Treaty of Paris
-------------------

The peace negotiations between Great Britain and the American
revolutionaries (as well as other interested European powers) started
in April 1782 and came to a text on November 30, 1782, it was signed
by September 3rd 1978 and fully ratified by all parties by April
9th 1784.

This was an intercontinental treaty, completely handwritten paper
based system using horse messengers and ships going back and forth
between the US and Europe. Yet, in less than two years, they made
world peace and setup the United States of America, including a
comprehensive free trade agreement and mutual respect of each other's
laws and borders.

The Treaty of Brussels
----------------------

The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June 2016. Since then not much
visible progress has been made in regaining control of the UK's laws,
money and borders.

After the vote, instead of immediately leaving the EU, leaving was
pushed to Friday, 29 March 2019, almost three years later. It remains
to be seen if this deadline will be met.

As an independence movement, it is not exactly motoring ahead. 

Brexit has direct train service between London and Brussels (1 hour 51
mins), email, computers etc etc. We donâ€™t even have to invent a new
country, we just have to go back to pre-EU policies.

The speed comparison between American Independence and Brexit shows
how ridiculously dysfunctional the EU is and how moribund and
atrophied the British state has become.

In this case, technology is not getting a good reputation, all these
great communication technologies are just prolonging the inevitable
rather than moving us closer to the eventual resolution.

However, at least to get to Brexit's beginning, we had a war of social
media memes rather than a war using rifles.

We will get there in the end
----------------------------

The USA set a shining example to all the other colonies of the British
empire and eventually the era of European global empires came to an
end. When Brexit finally happens, the UK won't be the last country to
leave the EU.
