Let them eat cake

On the 23rd June 2016, the people of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland were asked whether they wanted to leave or remain in the
European Union. 52% voted to leave while 48% voted to remain.

On April 10th 2016, ten weeks before the vote, ICM published `an opinion poll`_
that gave a four-point lead for Leave (52% vs 48%), which turned out
to be the correct result.

One explanation is that with several pollsters covering the
referendum, one has to be right; after all, even a stopped clock is
correct twice a day.

However, lets consider an alternative explanation, that the whole EU
referendum campaign made absolutely no difference to public opinion at
all.

Hundreds of millions of pounds spent by the campaigns, posters,
`Boris' bus slogan`_, acres of newspaper columns,
billions and trillions of tweets, all of it, didn't manage to
convince anyone of anything.

People are just not that into politics.

In other words, the day to day minutiae of events doesn't really
matter to the silent majority, they haven't got the time or the
inclination to care and why should they? It would be very conceited to
say the people should look up and spend their time listening to their
Lords and masters.

The print circulation of Britain's main broadsheet newspapers has
fallen so far they can barely scrape a million per day combined. What
percentage of their remaining readers do more than browse the news
before going straight to the crossword or the sport section?

Meanwhile, less than 200,000 people in the UK watch the BBC's political
programmes, but over 15 million people watch 'The Great British Bake
Off' on the same network, which is a cake baking competition.

As I `said on Twitter`_: Politics is important. However, cakes are 75
times more important.

In fact, I don't want to ever live in a country where politics is more
important than cake, it doesn't sound like a very benevolent regime.
