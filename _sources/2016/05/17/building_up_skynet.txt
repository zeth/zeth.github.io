Building up Skynet
==================

This has been a very exciting year. I burst out of the academy and
started a `new company`_ with a couple of other chaps called Rob and
Luke.

The idea is write a platform to help generate form-based applications,
which could absorb and display business data. We could then in the
future add machine learning/artificial intelligence type features, and
learn original ideas that have not been apparent without such
statistical modelling.

Basically we are trying to make Skynet, the singularity itself, which
we call Infomachine. Of course, being a start-up, it might evolve into
a different concept involving washing machines or something.

Meanwhile, some customers found their way to us and we have been doing
lots of consulting and contract software development. The customers
themselves are highly intelligent and beautiful people who have
extensive domain knowledge in their own field, and it has been very
interesting learning some of this as we write software to make their
companies more efficient or expand into new areas.

This all feeds back into the eventual completion of the Infomachine,
or not; maybe we will go in a completely different direction, that is
the fun part, there are just three of us in a (often virtual) room and
we can do whatever the heck we like.
