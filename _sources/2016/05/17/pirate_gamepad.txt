The Case of the Pirate Gamepad
==============================

I made some software (which will be explained in a future post) and
used my trusty Argos third-party PS3 style gamepad to control it.

On the way to open sourcing it, I thought I had better try it with a
an official Sony PS3 gamepad, and I could always do with another
gamepad for when playing computer with the sprog.

We play a lot of open source games like SuperTuxKart and Frogatto
which are two of our favourites. To be honest we play almost every
game made available through Debian's Apt.

So not really thinking too heavily about it, I popped onto a leading
auction website, typed in PS3 gamepad, saw that the first result cost
less than Â£13 including postage, and just bought it and moved
on. Total time spent was about a minute.

Later I thought it was a bit cheap but ignored the thought on the
basis that the PS3 is ten years old and has been long replaced by the
PS4. The controller that game was the one above. In the following box.

Initial impressions were that it was a little light and the D-pad was
different than I remember. However, it is probably been 5 years since
I touched an official PS3 gamepad and maybe they made production
improvements to make it lighter or I didn't really remember right.

However, as soon as I plugged it in, and typed `dmesg`, the controller
itself confessed to its real identity.::

A Gasia Co.,Ltd PS(R) Gamepad, what is that you may ask? Well so did I. It should look like this::

The controller was totally fake!

So it didn't help me generalise my software. Also these controllers
contain a Lithium battery so I am not comfortable putting this
counterfeit device in my child's hands. If they are so far beyond the
legal system that they do not need to care about the trademarks of
Sony, how much do they care about electrical safety? Or chemical
safety?

So I emailed my findings to the seller and they gave me an immediate
refund and didn't need to send the controller back. A counterfeiter
with great customer service! Bizarre.

It is amazing the level of detail they went to. It is itself an
interesting cultural artefact; a Chinese made plastic product
pretending to be a different Chinese made plastic product. It is
interesting philosophical discussion about if you use the same design,
make it in the same place and maybe even use the exact same parts,
what does genuine actually mean?

And what the heck is the markup on the official Sony controller if
another company can make an almost exact replica for a less than a
third of the price?

It is shame that people feel the need to be dishonest. A third party
PS3 controller does not need to hide its true nature. I love my Argos
one which has some useful extra features.

Surely selling the controller as what it is would be simpler than
having to sneak around and recreate accounts constantly on the auction
site?

If the manufacturer had said, "this is a PS3 compatible gamepad and it
is three times cheaper", then it could find its own market. While you
are at it, put in a higher capacity battery and better bluetooth
aerial than Sony's controller and win on both price and quality.

As for me, I bought an official wired Xbox 360 controller from
Argos. I actually prefer the shape ergonomically and it is more
reliably detected by Linux and is much cheaper than the PS3 gamepad.
