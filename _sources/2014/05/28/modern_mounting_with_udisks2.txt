Modern Mounting with Udisks2
============================

.. image:: /newimages/posts/modern_mounting_with_udisks2/mounted.jpg

In this post we look at the changes in disk mounting and then look at
the udisksctl command which allows you to automount disks from the
command line. Feel free to skip past the background info if you just
want to learn how to use the command.

Background
----------

In the beginning (Thursday, 1 January 1970?) to add a storage device
(such as a hard disk) to a computer was an infrequent affair, and
required the machine to be turned off.

So the classic system of disk mounting on a Posix ('Unix-like') system
was for the system administrator to list all the disks in a plain text
file systems table, which on most systems can be found in the file
/etc/fstab.

Nowadays servers often have the ability to add and remove disks
without turning the machine off. Even in desktop computers, SATA
drives have this facility too at least according to the SATA drive -
but it depends a lot on the manufacturer of motherboard controller
actually following the standard so it is not usually worth the risk.

The main thing that has really brought hotplugging into use is
external disks such as USB drives and other trendy connectors that
come and (mostly) go such as Firewire, eSata, Thunderbolt, etc.

In the early 2000s, the first attempt to cope with this was called
HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer, which did what it said on the tin,
provided a layer between device nodes and the user of the nodes, so
storage devices (and other hardware) can be added and removed without
rebooting this system and without rewriting the /etc/fstab file.

Then everything gets replaced a dizzying number of times (DeviceKit,
devfs, etc) as better approaches are discovered in a fast moving
period of hardware development, udev eventually won and was the main
thing for the rest of the decade.

When a device is added or removed from the system, the Linux kernel
notices and sends out an event. Udev is a daemon that waits around
listening for these events and then responding accordingly. udev runs
in user space not kernel space which is good for security as you
cannot plug in a USB stick and take over the kernel like on some
proprietary operating systems.

In 2012, the `udev project merged`_ into the systemd project; systemd is
the next generation (or current generation for some distributions)
system and service manager. Systemd is really cool and is being
adopted by most of the major distributions but it is still a year or
two away in some cases depending on their release cycles.

Anyway, the point is that if you want to control disks on the command
line and you are using the mount command you are 20 years out of
date. Enough history, lets get to the flesh.

Command Line Usage
------------------

When you hot plug disks in the system, the graphical interface
automatically reacts and provides buttons to mount, unmount and so
on. However, if you have accessed a machine remotely, or just like to
use the command line, then this post will tell you how to use the same
automounting approach as the GUI.

For a system controlled by udev (or systemd), one command line tool is
called udisks. It has two versions, in the original version 1, the
command is udisks, for the second version udisks2, it is udisksctl.

If you don't have these commands already installed then you will have
to install the udisks2 or udisks packages. In the case of the Debian
distribution, udisks is in Wheezy and udisks2 is in Jessie. I seem to
have both installed for some reason, possibly because I started at
Wheezy and upgraded to Jessie.

Anyway, we will look at the newest one, udisksctl.

udisksctl
---------

The main commands follow, there are several more that can be seen with:

.. code-block:: bash

    udisksctl help

To see a list of disks attached to the system:

.. code-block:: bash

    udisksctl status

For a very in depth list of disk information:

.. code-block:: bash

    udisksctl dump

To mount a filesystem:

.. code-block:: bash

    udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1

You don't need to give a location, it will sort that out automatically
for you. On my system it mounts the disk at /media/username/label
where username is obviously your username and label is the label of
the disk partition, other distributions may deal with it differently.

To unmount a filesystem:

.. code-block:: bash

    udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdb1

Note that the command is unmount with an N, not umount like the
classic command.

Note that these command names autocomplete which is kinda cool.

udisks
------

The old udisks command is pretty similar except instead of giving a command
name, you give an argument, e.g. to get the full disk information:

.. code-block:: bash

    udisks --dump

Instead of status, it has --enumerate. This option lists partitions instead
of physical disks like in the newer udisksctl.

Go forth and mount
------------------

So udisksctl is pretty cool, we can now mount and unmount disks from
the command line in the same way as the GUI. Do remember that the disk
information from the udisksctl dump command can quite be useful when
wanting to know about the disks attached to a system.
