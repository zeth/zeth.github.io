Manually Fulfilling Dependencies on Debian
==========================================

msmtp is yet another Mail Transfer Agent that merely relays the
outgoing email message to another (e.g. your ISP's) SMTP server. There
seems to be quite a lot of these, but this one seems to be the most
actively maintained - `see its homepage on sourceforge`_ for more
information and documentation. At time of writing, the last stable
release is March 9, 2014 which is very recent.

Other similar ones, such as ssmtp, esmtp and nbsmtp, still seem to
work, they are pretty simple programs with few dependencies apart from
the C environment which basically never changes anymore and they are
recompiled and repackaged regularly by the distributions.

I have a machine running on Debian stable but wanted a newer version
of msmtp than is packaged for stable. So I cloned the source code
using git and compiled it.

However, after removing the default mail transfer agent (Exim),
Debian's apt command is desperate to re-install it.

So I needed to tell the system that I already have a mail transfer
agent. This post explains how I did it. I don't know if this is the
correct 'modern' way to do it, but it worked for me, and it is quite
interesting because it exposes a little of how Apt works under the
hood.

Fortunately, my problem is the use case given in the old Apt Howto
under the section called 
`4.1 How to install locally compiled packages: equivs`_ there is
more useful information there.

The package that helps us to circumvent Debian package dependencies is
called equivs, so first I needed to install that.  sudo apt-get
install equivs

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install equivs

Next I ran the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    equivs-control msmtp-git

This created a template Debian control file. I gave it a meaningful
name, i.e. msmtp installed from git.

I added the following lines:

.. code-block:: control

    Package: msmtp-git
    Provides: mail-transport-agent

The `Provides` line is the key, it tells the system that a
mail-transport-agent is installed.
    
Then I created a .deb from this control file.

.. code-block:: bash

    equivs-build msmtp-git

Lastly I installed the deb:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo dpkg --install  msmtp-git_1.0_all.deb

Pretty weird but it works.
