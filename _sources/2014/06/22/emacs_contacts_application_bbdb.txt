Managing Contacts in Emacs with BBDB
====================================

This post is about BBDB (Big Brother Database), which is the main
contacts application available for Emacs.

Contacts Application for Emacs
------------------------------

BBDB is packaged within distributions, albeit quite old versions of it
are packaged within Debian at the time of writing.

Information about BBDB can be found at its `Savannah homepage`_, and
most importantly `downloads are found here`_. I wanted the latest
version so I downloaded it from there.

The latest versions (that begin with 3, e.g. 3.1.2) require Emacs 23
or 24, an older version of Emacs will require version 2 of BBDB;
although it is much nicer for other reasons to use the latest version
of Emacs that you can get.

The README_ gives full instructions to get set up. Basically, like
with most other Emacs libraries, you make the library available by
editing the ~/.emacs file and using the require function.

.. code-block:: scheme

    (require 'bbdb-loaddefs "/path/to/bbdb/lisp/bbdb-loaddefs.el")

Storage Format
--------------

Despite the name ending in DB, contacts are stored in a plain text
file at ~/emacs.d/bbdb (where ~ represents the user's home directory).

It is worth knowing that each line in the file is a contact, which
takes the form of a vector, this is a LISP data type similar to a
JavaScript Array or Python list (but items are delimited with spaces
rather than commas).

If you ever edit the file by hand or with code you write yourself, it
is important to keep one item to a line, if a line break gets removed
then BBDB will reject the file until you fix it.

Since it is a plain text file, you can do back it up easily, sync it
between computers, write scripts that do things to it, track it with
git or whatever you can imagine.

Importing Contacts
------------------

If you already have a load of contacts somewhere, then the best way to
get started is to import them from there. I personally had a load of
contacts in Google Contacts that had been built up from my Gmail
account and Android phone.

I used a lovely little Python script called charrington_ which grabbed
all the contacts from Google and added them to a bbdb file.

Using BBDB
----------

As always, M is for Meta which means Alt on an IBM-PC style keyboard.

Typing M-x bbdb allows you to search for a contact. So if I search for
Elizabeth, I get this contact:

The other commands all start with bbdb- for example, M-x bbdb-create
allows you to type in a new record. There is almost a hundred
commands, but you do not need to remember them. Using tab completion
shows them all, they are also organised in a toolbar menu.

If you have imported lots of contacts from Google Contacts, then
sometimes different pieces of information about a person are stored
under different names.

One of the most useful things is M-x bbdb-search-duplicates, this
allows you to merge contacts together and/or delete duplicate contacts.

Sending Mail
------------

When you have point over a record, pressing m will allow you to
compose an email to the person. Emacs then drops you into message mode.

Email in Emacs is another topic entirely, but if you put the following
into your ~/.emacs file then you have setup the absolute basics:

.. code-block:: scheme

    (setq user-mail-address "youremail@example.com"
        user-full-name "Your Name")

If you have a mail transport agent or relay (such as mstmp) setup then
Emacs can pass the email to whatever is pointed to by
/usr/sbin/sendmail or you can use Emacs `itself to relay email`_.

Other features
--------------

Pressing simply e edits the current line. ; allows you to write an
attached note. If the record has a www field then W displays the web
page.

You can even phone your contacts directly from Emacs! Typing M-d will
phone the current contact; obviously you need to have a modem or some
other kind of phone system setup.

Various mail and news packages for Emacs can make use of your contacts
to provide auto-fill functions, e.g. in the To: field of an email.
