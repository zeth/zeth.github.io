<p>For those reading later, Facebook was an early 21st Century “Social
Network”, it was web application that you can sign up to and share
text and pictures with other users.</p>
<div class="section" id="tangent-on-why-i-don-t-use-facebook">
<h2>1. Tangent on why I don’t use Facebook</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/scrabble.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/scrabble.png"/>
<p>I was at University when Facebook started so I got an early invite
when it was a University based system. I quit in 2006 when it became
available to the whole public and stopped being connected to the
physical campus. I am not some kind of elitist, it just lost any
meaning to me at that point. I am surprised it is still going a whole
decade later.</p>
<p>There are no real barriers to talk any of my old school friends, many
have parents still living in the same place as my parents and moving
in the same circles as my parents but for whatever reason we didn’t
bother keeping up.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was being collected by such people in the race to get more
‘friends’ and was being distracted with requests to play scrabble and
vote on things and so on.</p>
<p>Many normal people seem to have taken on this horrific American
practice of presenting a horribly bland PR-style over-positive view of
yourself. Everyone on Facebook is Hyacinth Bucket from Keeping Up
Appearances.</p>
<p>Unless, like Pheidippides, you brought important news about how you have
defeated the Persians and then died on the finish line, I don’t really
care about the marathons you are training for.</p>
<p>Unless you are sending me a slice, I don’t care about the cake you
made. Unless you have wired it up as an IoT project, I really don’t
care about your cat.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-the-web-to-the-mesh">
<h2>2. From the Web to the Mesh</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/cyborg_cheshire_cat.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/cyborg_cheshire_cat.png"/>
<p>For those in the military and Universities, we made our own
networks. To provide internet to homes and businesses, commercial ISPs
moved in.</p>
<p>This however was not the only possible model. Before BT was
privatised, it had its own plan to provide a national data network to
be run by the post office.</p>
<p>Since then, hundreds of municipal wireless networks have been
setup. Wikipedia <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_wireless_network">maintains a big list</a>.</p>
<p>Rather more interestingly, there are many attempts to get away from
the centralised, corporate/government controlled Internet altogether.</p>
<p>Remove the ISPs, the DNS, etc and just depend on distributed Mesh
Networks where every node has everything required to fully connect to
the other nodes. This is a mathematically superior approach which in
the end will require a lot less electricity, bureaucracy and cost.</p>
<p>However, when all nodes are equal, there is not any obvious point
where organisations like the CIA or GCHQ can stick themselves as a man
in the middle, and there is little ability for the government to
censor or cut anyone off using easy digital means.</p>
<p>But it is fine. It is too expensive to make water pipes care if you
use the water for drinking, cleaning your car or for water boarding a
terrorist suspect.</p>
<p>It is not economic to replace the roads with special surfaces that
turn to mud if a bank robber is performing a getaway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-still-miss-gopher">
<h2>3. I still miss Gopher</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/mesh.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/mesh.png"/>
<p>In 1991, the leading Internet content protocol was Gopher. It had
automatic client-side formatting and strong typing of content files,
removing many security problems that WWW faced.</p>
<p>It was also easy for anyone to add to gopherspace, you didn’t need
coding or graphic skills.</p>
<p>However, WWW was completely public domain so won, despite its
technological shortcomings. By 2017, we have lots of tools like
markdown, bootstrap, Jekyll/Sphinx etc which mean you don’t have to
put a lot of work into making a readable website.</p>
<p>This blog is statically generated using Sphinx and there is no
serverside code. I am paying absolutely nothing for you to read this.</p>
<p>It is getting easier all the time, but it is still not as easy as it
should be to add your own content to WWW.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social-networks-suck">
<h2>4. Social Networks Suck</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/facebook.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/facebook.png"/>
<p>To bridge this easy to read/hard to write gap, the social networks
jumped in. These are easy for people to quickly post their cat photos
and show off.</p>
<p>The concept ‘net neutrality’ describes how the WWW is (supposed to be)
broadly content indifferent, it is just a pipe to push information
through. Mesh networks described above take this concept even further.</p>
<p>Social networks are a downgrade from WWW, in that now content is
inside silos that are centrally controlled by a private company with
no requirement to enforce freedom of speech.</p>
<p>James Delingpole <a class="reference external" href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/03/17/delingpole-facebook-banned-me-for-defending-milo/">wrote an article about his problems</a> being a
centrist/conservative journalist and media personality using West
Coast controlled social networks to promote his work:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For some of you this won’t matter because Facebook. You think Mark
Zuckerberg is a weird sociopath, that it’s a cesspit of festering
left-liberalism, that social media is a waste of time. Yes I get
that - but you don’t work in the media, whereas I do and for all
of us in the communications industry whether we’re writers,
entertainers, journalists, bloggers, vloggers or podcasters
Facebook is a big deal because so much of our audience is on
it. And it’s as important to those of us on the right as it is on
the left.</div></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a lot of work.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/noise.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/noise.png"/>
<p>James Delingpole has a nice podcast, if his content is good enough,
his fans will share it, it doesn’t matter if he is on Facebook
himself.</p>
<p>I am probably too old for Milo, but I notice that every time Milo does
something, it still appears on Twitter, despite Milo being banned,
because his limitless undergraduate fans share it.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I used to play MUD games and even wrote one once. One
famous MUD had inside its introductory help file, something like
“don’t base your life on a game you don’t control and can be banned
from.”</p>
<p>Kind of why I stopped playing MUDs, when you find a MUD that doesn’t
ban you, they tend to put you in charge. You cannot really play in
peace as a casual player, even if you try to, someone will redesign
the world half way through and negate all the time you put into
building a character.</p>
<p>Another way of putting it is James is like an Ambassador to the USSR.</p>
<p>An Ambassador to a hostile country should always know they are on
borrowed time. At any time the host country can revoke the credentials
and force a replacement.</p>
<p>Maybe the Ambassador did something wrong, maybe not, maybe they were
just too effective or were not able to be turned.</p>
<p>The Ambassador shouldn’t go native and base his life on being able to
stay.</p>
<p>To take a different analogy, Western bishops used diplomatic charm to
try to protect Russian Christians from being killed by the Atheist
USSR.</p>
<p>No doubt useful work but appeasement and trying to fix the USSR wasn’t
what won the cold war.</p>
<p>It was consumer goods, making the free world demonstrably better for
ordinary people, this is what brought down the USSR.</p>
<p>Facebook is a totalitarian state, some people thrive there but
generally, it is better to get out while you can.</p>
<p>The semi-free world is the WWW, the really free world is the Mesh, the
darknet, peer-to-peer networks and Tor.</p>
<p>If possible, I want to build up the free world but it will happen
anyway if it is meant to. Technology may or not be imbibed with a
spirit, but it seems to have an inevitability about it.</p>

<div class="section" id="jesus-vs-pontius-pilate">
<h2>5. Jesus Vs Pontius Pilate</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/net.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/net.png"/>
<p>Pontius Pilate served as governor of Judaea then retired to his villa
in Rome. Did he even remember executing Jesus? To him it would have
seemed like one of many local disputes he dealt with. Being a colonial
overlord was known to be a hard gig.</p>
<p>Pilate got a lot of bad PR, being the baddy of the Christmas story but
that was later. Pilate was most probably already dead long before
Christianity spread far enough for Rome to notice it.</p>
<p>Jesus got tortured and executed then got a billion followers and a
seat at the right hand of God, but no villa.</p>
<p>Jesus had two friends named James, his brother and James, son of
Zebedee. One was thrown off the temple and/or stoned to death, the
other had his head cut off with a sword (Acts 12:1-2). James does have
a cathedral built over where his head was buried but he didn’t get a
villa either.</p>
<p>It is one thing to get millions or billion of followers, it is another
thing to keep your head on your shoulders as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-silent-majority">
<h2>6. The silent majority</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/quiet.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/quiet.png"/>
<p>I never really felt like being a Jesus figure. Most people don’t, I
talked a lot about the <a class="reference external" href="http://zeth.net/2016/08/02/let_them_eat_cake.html">silent majority</a> before.</p>
<p>The loudest people in tech are from the West Coast of the
USA. Meanwhile, software developers and professors working within
Universities can go native and be as left wing as the other
professors.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of developers are like the majority of most
other people, just in the centre.</p>
<p>The crazy far-left minority are just disproportionately loud. When
they bring their politics into a space or event not to do with
politics, people mostly just politely humour them and nod along while
looking at their watches or checking their phones.</p>
<p>No one breaks their bubble, people are keen not to prolong it any
further. They have organised childcare or transport and want to just
get on with fly-fishing or software development or whatever got them
to the event.</p>
<p>Those far-lefties without self awareness may take this to mean
everyone agrees, however this is a mistake, they are unprepared for
events like Brexit or Trump when the majority show they don’t really
care that much about their sacred cows.</p>
<p>Once all the centrist and the conservative speakers have been purged
from Facebook, the silent majority will just silently fade out as
their timeline gets boring and other things get invented that are more
interesting than pictures of cats.</p>
<p>VR, IoT, the Mesh’s first killer app, whatever. There is always
something new.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-is-progress">
<h2>7. Technology is progress</h2>
<p>A lot of the crazy left today is anti-technological. It is mathematics
that will save the world not socialism or “Intersectionality”.</p>
<p>The famous book by Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;R) has done more to
progress humanity than Marx’s Communist Manifesto.</p>
<p>As I expressed in parts 14 and 15 of <a class="reference external" href="http://zeth.net/2017/02/13/deplorables_hysterics_maastricht_trump.html">my previous essay</a>: politics, as
expressed in parliament, is really not that important. It is just
dealing with the effects of technological change.</p>
<p>The character of Viktor Komarovsky in the famous Boris Pasternak novel
Doctor Zhivago is a businessman or fixer who works with and benefits
from the aristocracy. When Communism takes over, he carries on in the
same role just with new clients.</p>
<p>Over the Twentieth Century, politics and culture have lurched back and
forth from free market capitalism to socialism to this current
corporatism and now we may be going back to capitalism.</p>
<p>However, software has just pressed on. From Turing through to K&amp;R to
Linus Torvalds and so on, we are in a line. Moore’s law, the compiler,
the web, robotics, AI, the singularity. No one can stop us.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/ponies.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/ponies.png"/>
<p>2016 led to a clear divide between the Deplorables and the
Hysterics. Where did this come from?  What is the historical context
of Brexit? What should we in the UK make of President Trump? What role
did technology play in making this division?</p>
<p>This is another long read typed at the speed of thought, as always,
corrections and improvements are appreciated.</p>
<div class="section" id="where-to-begin">
<h2>1. Where to begin</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/deplorable.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/deplorable.jpg"/>
<p>In my first essay on Brexit, <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs The Matrix</a>, I started at the last
Ice Age and went through each of the attempts to include Britain in a
United Europe project. This post will be somewhat more modern.</p>
<p>The 1975 referendum was a Labour affair, the pro-EU yes campaign led
by Harold Wilson and the No campaign led by the great Tony Benn.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/benn.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/benn.jpg"/>
<p>In 1975, Benn and the leavers were accused of wanting to turn the UK
into an island of socialist utopia, it is not so relevant to this
current hysteria.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will start my story at 1992, for in retrospect, this is
where the Leave campaign began its march to successfully winning a
referendum on leaving the EU in 2016.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maastricht-rebels-the-battle-of-the-bastards">
<h2>1. Maastricht Rebels - the battle of the bastards</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/rebels.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/rebels.jpg"/>
<p>One of the reasons that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s long and
electorally successful leadership was challenged by her own party was
her resistance to further European integration.</p>
<p>Under her more successor, John Mayor, the 1992 Maastricht Treaty was
negotiated. This converted the European Community to the European
Union, including European Economic and Monetary Union (the Euro being
finally set up on in 1 January 1999), but also lots of other areas of
policy being handed over to the European level.</p>
<p>This was not popular in the British parliament. Ratification was not
easy or quick and took another 18 months. A vote on one wrecking
amendment was tied 317-317 and only defeated because of the 1876
convention of the speaker breaking ties by voting no.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major famously called three members of his cabinet
(Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo), the “bastards” -
which was a still a controversial insult back in 1993.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while this Tory civil war was happening in Parliament, over
at the Bank of England and the Treasury, there was a different
European problem.</p>
<p>The inability to find an interest rate that would fit both Germany and
the UK led to a run on the pound and consequently the UK being ejected
from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday, further
pushing the UK away from Europe.</p>
<p>The combination of Black Wednesday, the way Thatcher was deposed and
the way Prime Minister John Major ruthlessly pushed the Maastricht
Treaty through parliament, splintered his party and the wider
conservative movement, and now in retrospect, sowed the inevitable
seeds of Brexit.</p>
<p>The elite MPs in control of the party machine had become de-anchored
from the mass of the Conservative party membership and the general
public. This led to a landslide defeat at the 1997 election and 13
years out of power.</p>
<p>However, those anti-EU forces created in the Maastricht ratification
process continued in the background.</p>
<p>Some of the leading 1992 rebels are still in parliament, for example,
Sir Bill Cash. While some of the younger ones, such as Dr Liam Fox and
Iain Duncan Smith, became the backbone of the Leave campaign.</p>
<p>Outside of the Tories, UKIP was began in response to the Maastricht
Treaty, it came into being between 1991 and 1993. On the day John
Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, an up and coming 27 year
-old conservative called Nigel Farage quit the Tories and became
UKIP’s first nationally recognised leader.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-great-euro-non-debate">
<h2>2. The great Euro non-debate</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/yah.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/yah.jpg"/>
<p>By 1996, Britain’s place in Europe was not clear, with the Tory
members and much of the public wanting less Europe, while the pro-EU
John Major and big business wanting the UK to join the Euro in time
for its launch in 1999.</p>
<p>For ten years between 1995-ish to 2005-ish, there were two
competing campaigns on the Euro.</p>
<p>There was the campaign, financed by big business, for Britain to join
the Euro, with prophesies of doom and irrelevance if the UK didn’t join.</p>
<p>This culminated in the group Britain in Europe led by Tony Blair (in
theory but unwilling to expend political capital on it), Gordon Brown
(in theory but in practice going the other way, as we shall see below)
as well Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Charles Kennedy and so on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side, the was No Campaign primarily backed
by Sir Tim Rice of musical theatre fame and supported by all the
“bastards” from part 1 above.</p>
<p>All this preparation by the two campaigns happened in a kind of
political-geek parallel universe, it never bothered the general
public. Eventually, the money ran out and the two campaigns faded out
before they really started but it was a practice run for 2016 when
many of the same characters and same old arguments would re-emerge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="things-can-only-get-better">
<h2>3. Things can only get better</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/balls.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/balls.jpg"/>
<p>In the 1997 election, Labour outflanked the pro-EU John Major by pushing
the Euro question into the long grass, with the famous <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_economic_tests">five Economic
Tests</a>, reportedly invented by Ed Balls in the back of a New
York taxi.</p>
<p>A work of electoral genius, Labour now had defused its own European
divisions with this technocratic measure. Those against further
integration could see the tests were not currently met and could hold
faith that convergence would never happen, while those in favour of
further integration could hold faith that convergence would naturally
occur and the tests would one day be met.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the UK and Eurozone economies diverged and the
prospect of the UK joining the Euro stopped becoming a realistic
option to anyone but the most extreme Euro-federalists, a rare breed
in the UK.</p>
<p>The UK entered the 2008 financial crisis with more dodgy banks and a
bigger national deficit than most of the Eurozone, including Southern
Europe.</p>
<p>However, the UK having an independent currency acted as an automatic
stabiliser and the UK made it through the crisis relatively unscathed
in the short term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those in Southern Europe, lumbered with an unsuitably
strong currency, suffered immeasurably more, proving the UK had dodged
a bullet. The economic situation of Greece is what the alternative
future of the UK could have been had we adopted the Euro currency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="big-business-credibility-problem">
<h2>4. Big business credibility problem</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/apocalypse.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/apocalypse.jpg"/>
<p>The abortive pro-Euro campaign was led by big business such as the
City of London banks, Lord Sainsbury and so on, as well as the
international institutions and think tanks. The exact same people and
organisations that came back in the Remain Campaign of 2016. Not
entirely, some like James Dyson and JCB had moved to the Leave
campaign.</p>
<p>A lot of the “project fear”-type arguments had been made in the late
1990s and early 2000s about staying out of the Euro. However, the
reality of the financial crisis had proved them all wrong, not
entering the Euro had saved the UK.</p>
<p>The credibility problem of the UK pro-European campaigners was pretty
clear to anyone with eyes to see in the outcome of the UK financial
crisis.</p>
<p>Those against the EU since 1992 had been largely winning on democratic
and legal grounds but losing the economic argument. However, in the
aftermath of the financial crisis, the economic argument for the EU as
an economic magic bullet was becoming increasingly untenable as the UK
economy recovered steadily while the populations of many Eurozone
countries were being collectively punished with mass unemployment in
order to keep their economies within the Euro.</p>
<p>This is the background to the later Michael Gove style argument, why
trust these people and groups when they always get their predictions
wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lisbon-loons">
<h2>5. Lisbon Loons</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/harley_quinn.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/harley_quinn.png"/>
<p>The 2010 Conservative manifesto was called
“<a class="reference external" href="https://www.conservatives.com/~/media/Files/Manifesto2010">Invitation to join the government of Britain</a>” (PDF)
and on pages 113 to 114 (pdf page number 124-125), promised a
referendum before handing over any more
powers to Europe.</p>
<p>However, when it came to the Lisbon Treaty, David Cameron weaseled out
and said the promise would apply to every treaty <em>after</em> the Lisbon
Treaty.</p>
<p>The Lisbon treaty was a massive step forward in the federalisation of
Europe and the last major treaty likely to be approved for a long
time, so Cameron’s promise turned out to be worthless (like all his
other promises).</p>
<p>Some Tory MPs tried to honour the promise anyway, here we quote a
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/18/david-cameron-ally-activists-loons">2013 Guardian Article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The senior Tory made the remarks - in earshot of journalists - after
being asked about the decision of 116 Tory MPs to defy the prime
minister and vote in favour of an amendment regretting the absence of
a EU referendum in the Queen’s speech.</p>
<p>The Conservative said: “It’s fine. There’s really no problem. The MPs
just have to do it because the associations tell them to, and the
associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Major called his rebel MP bastards, the Cameron set now considered the
largely Eurosceptic rank and file to be “mad, swivel-eyed
loons”. Cameron had the coalition with the Liberal Democrats to
average out the Eurosceptism of the Tory membership.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cameron-in-a-corner">
<h2>6. Cameron in a corner</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/cameron.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/cameron.png"/>
<p>Cameron entered the 2015 election with a promise to renegotiate its
relationship with Europe and put that to an in/out
referendum - page 72 (PDF page 74) of the <a class="reference external" href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf">2015 manifesto</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>How this was supposed to work in David’s Cameron’s mind probably
involved the context of a coalition with the Lib Dems.</p>
<p>In the months before the 2015 election, the media has factored in an
Ed Miliband victory or at least the unpopular David Cameron would be
scrabbling around for a coalition with the Lib Dems who might be
smaller but still significant.</p>
<p>Instead, the Tories won an outright majority, not least because the
referendum pledge re-united the grassroots behind the government
rather than UKIP. Cameron came back into power in 2015 with a party
more Eurosceptic than ever.</p>
<p>The most pro-EU party, the Lib Dems went from 57 seats to 8 seats,
i.e. an 86% loss.</p>
<p>While many MPs were loyal to David Cameron in the referendum, they
were answerable to extremely Euro-sceptic local parties, and
constituencies that were increasingly Eurosceptic too.</p>
<p>In the manifesto, David Cameron had promised to hold the referendum by
the end of 2017, however pretty much the day after the 7th May 2015
election, Britain’s place in the EU became the hot topic to the
exclusion of everything else.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, in April 2016, I remember thinking then that
pretty much every argument that could be made, had been made. Luckily,
David Cameron set the date of the vote to the 23rd June.</p>
<p>On the 24th of June, I was like phew, finally we can talk about
something else but Britain leaving Europe, but no, the losing side
didn’t disarm but carried on campaigning. We still are drowning in
this one issue. Anyway I am getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Why did Cameron hold the vote earlier than needed? Did he believe it
the European issue was preventing progress on any other issue? Did he
believe he had it in the bag? Did he want a successful remain vote to
be his legacy act before leaving the stage?</p>
<p>Perhaps his hand was forced by Merkel and Hollande, not wanting the UK
relationship to become an issue in the 2017 French and German
elections (well they failed there).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-campaign">
<h2>7. The campaign</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/twilight.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/twilight.png"/>
<p>I have talked a lot about the campaign and why leave won and the
mistakes made by remain. Remain didn’t put their best arguments
first. Remain didn’t update their arguments to take account of
the 2008 financial crisis and the situation in Greece.</p>
<p>The Leave campaign had seen all the remain arguments coming from 15
years before and were ready for them.</p>
<p>I have covered the economic side in other posts and why Brexit didn’t
cause an immediate recession as promised by the project fear (which
had lost all credibility in the previous iteration 4 - The Gove
argument).</p>
<p>I could talk about a lot of things but want to focus one thing, namely
what those who wanted to leave were called by the remain campaigners.</p>
<p>Like “bastards” and “mad, swivel-eyed loons”, the elite hysterically
called the people names. I went back to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07gbrq9/question-time-09062016">9th June 2015 edition of
Question Time</a> (link will expire 12th June 2017) and made a list, in
this single program, leavers were called:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Economically illiterate</li>
<li>Manics that want to burn the economy</li>
<li>Little Englanders</li>
<li>Uneducated</li>
<li>Trying to cause third world war in Europe.</li>
<li>Liars</li>
<li>Nazis</li>
<li>Removing hope from the world</li>
<li>Causing the breakup of the United Kingdom</li>
<li>Want to cause a civil war in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This was just one episode of one program, we had months of it. Later
in the campaign it escalated to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Old people should not be allowed to vote</li>
<li>Leavers are all racists that caused the Murderer of Jo Cox and a wave of crime</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>My favourite was when President of the European Council <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/project-fear-turn-11-brexit-spell-end-western-civilisation-says-donald-tusk/">Donald Tusk said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I fear that Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of
not only the EU but also of western political civilisation in its
entirety.</div></blockquote>
<p>If the remain campaigners were confident in their economic case, there
would not have needed to be this demonising of the leavers. It was an
act of desperation, a slow communal mental breakdown of the ruling
class, the delayed unwinding of the pre-2008 globalist consensus.</p>

<h2>8. The people are not bothered</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/bothered.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/bothered.jpg"/>
<p>Despite all that constant fear mongering and rhetoric by the elite,
52% of the UK voters bravely decided to leave anyway. According to the
pollsters Yougov and ICM, many more have joined the cause since the
vote.</p>
<p>The institutions and elites and dire apocalyptic warnings have become
like crying wolf, they have lost any credibility whatsoever, and just
makes those who make them distrusted.</p>
<p>The people have become shame-proof, moan proof. But they remember who
calls them names.</p>
<p>I think it is pretty hard to shame anyone into anything, it is not how
you win anything. You win by building the biggest coalition. Remain
could have possibly built a massive coalition but it didn’t want to,
it preferred to call people names, especially the working class and
the old.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-a-galaxy-far-far-away">
<h2>9. In a galaxy far far away</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/hobbits.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/hobbits.jpg"/>
<p>Meanwhile on the other side of the pond something else was
stirring. In 2011, Republican Senator John McCain called the
Republican grassroots “<a class="reference external" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/176055--mccain-not-sorry-for-tea-party-hobbits-comment">Tea Party Hobbits</a>“</p>
<p>In 2016, Hillary Clinton in her election campaign said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of
Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of
deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic,
Islamaphobic - you name it. And unfortunately there are people
like that. And he has lifted them up.</div></blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump had over 65 million votes. Any person with common sense
knows there is not over 30 million racists and sexists running around.</p>
<p>The situation is not 100% the same as the UK but it is comparable in
that it again demonising the population. I always thought Trump would
win the Republican primary but this speech was the moment that I knew
Hillary would lose.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-is-the-heck-is-trump-anyway">
<h2>10. Who is the heck is Trump anyway?</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/trump.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/trump.png"/>
<p>The same people calling leavers names, the people with the repeated
credibility problems are now telling us that “Trump is literally
Hitler”.</p>
<p>The 52% had to become thick skinned already and are suspicious of the
elite media and institutions.</p>
<p>I was already slightly immune to this. For almost every US election in
my lifetime, the winning President has been called evil or invalid by
the losing side. It is all very hysterical until silly season ends and
life moves on to some issue of the day.</p>
<p>Reagan was called a second rate actor and conman, until he lead the
fight against the Soviet Union and was considered a hero.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton was derided as a socialist who was going to bring back
the USSR yet many agree Clinton managed the economy far better than
many of his predecessors and successors and kept America safe. It was
the end of a golden age which his two successors largely bungled and
threw away.</p>
<p>Piers Morgan said that Trump cannot be worse than George W. Bush who
lied about weapons of mass destruction to get us into a poorly planned
War in Iraq which led to a million civilian deaths and thousands of
American, British and other soldiers being killed and even more being
maimed.</p>
<p>I have a lot of sympathy for that statement.</p>
<p>Obama was derided as a Kenyan Muslim communist who would introduce
death panels to wipe out old people. It is all just hysteria every time.</p>
<p>The greatest American president in history is FDR who saved the world
from “literally Hitler” i.e. the actual Hitler.</p>
<p>Based on the limited amount of time that Trump has been in office,
perhaps he is somewhere between the extremes of W. Bush and FDR ... as in
no-one knows. Presidents rarely are remembered for how they started or
what they campaigned for; events happen and the narrative always
changes after the fact. Ask me in the year 2047 if Trump was good or
bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sex-is-not-our-business">
<h2>11. Sex is not our business</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/monica.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/monica.jpg"/>
<p>When President Clinton, a 50 year-old married man, had relations with
a naïve and impressionable 22 year-old White House intern, he was
criticised domestically.</p>
<p>The UK has quite strong laws and policies on the abuse of a position
of trust so a UK politician doing exactly the same thing today would
not survive but given the Jimmy Savile revelations who knows what they
could get away with back then.</p>
<p>However, in general in the UK, we don’t care about our politicians’
sex lives. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>Most people would find it hard to pick many of our Prime Minister’s
spouses or children out in a crowd. We generally leave the spouses and
children out of the public limelight. We have the Royal Family for all
that.</p>
<p>Andrea Leadsom ended the referendum campaign as one of the winners, a
woman on the up, she was in the running to succeed David Cameron as
Prime Minister. When she was perceived, perhaps unfairly, to be
playing the motherhood card, the media threw it back in her face in
the most extreme way and her leadership bid came to a shuddering halt.</p>
<p>The position of the UK government on the Lewinsky scandal was that it
was none of our business. When asked about this Blair said the words
of Ruth (1:16):</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will
lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God”</div></blockquote>
<p>Blair was always over the top but here he was correct. The
transatlantic alliance between the US and UK is not about the
personality of the current leaders, it is a permanent alliance between
two peoples with the same language and many of the same values: common
law, freedom, the enlightenment, strong defence against our enemies,
democracy, rule of law and so on.</p>
<p>What is good for the Democrats is good for the Republicans, let’s not
worry what President Trump said to a friend on a bus in 2005. I really
don’t want to go down the route of making political capital out of our
politicians’ private lives.</p>
<p>As Jesus (may have) said, let him who is without sin cast the first
stone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-are-not-doing-a-merger">
<h2>12. We are not doing a merger</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/merger.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/merger.png"/>
<p>The US and the UK have many differences, often determined by our
histories and geography.</p>
<p>America feared the Royal Navy would lead a surprise attack on the US and
topple the government, so militias were part of the national defence.</p>
<p>The UK doesn’t have a second amendment because we obviously don’t fear
the British invading, we never had a tradition of mass gun
ownership. When the British Bill of Rights talked about a right to
bear arms it meant pikes. Our traditional solution to national defence
was to fill the sea around us with ships and cannons.</p>
<p>During the existential struggle that was World War II, most of the UK
population worked in the military or for the state directly or
indirectly, everyone became used to getting healthcare and wanted to
keep it after the war.</p>
<p>Churchill opposed healthcare free at the point of use in 1945 and the
population kicked him out as Prime Minister, when he changed his mind,
the voters gave him his job back.</p>
<p>So in the UK, there is a seven decade national consensus behind free
at the point of use healthcare.</p>
<p>In the US, you get what you earn. It is the American way. The
successful and hard working get the best healthcare in the world and
the unlucky, the unsuccessful or lazy get pretty basic care or nothing.</p>
<p>In the UK, it is full on socialised medicine and it is a mean
average - everyone gets the same - rich or poor. We do have waiting
lists, we do ration. In a crunch, the system does put the needs of
children and working age people above the old.</p>
<p>New expensive treatments may not be initially available like in the
US. The NHS might sit on its hands and wait for the producer to reduce
the price or for a cheaper treatment to come available. Doctors won’t
do meaningless tests for the sake of making money. People that are not
sick or have minor things that can be self-treated, are told not to
bother wasting a doctor’s time.</p>
<p>The minority of rich people who don’t like it, generally move to
America and buy healthcare there. However, generally it works. The
user has almost no paperwork to fill out.</p>
<p>While we do have waiting lists, you get on with your normal life, when
you get to the appointed time, it is generally quite businesslike and
there is not a lot of waiting inside the hospital, except when it all
goes wrong because of staff shortages or planning foul ups, etc.</p>
<p>Gun control and healthcare and many other issues are domestic
policies. We do not need the UK and the US to be the same.</p>
<p>Some people in the UK criticise the wall and Trump’s policies on
border control. The UK is surrounded by rough, cold and unforgiving
seas on all sides, it is a little bit hypocritical for the UK to
criticise. In any case, it is for their own voters to decide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="allies-not-clones">
<h2>13. Allies not clones</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/ukus.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/ukus.jpg"/>
<p>The important issue is how can the UK and US work together better to
our mutual benefit? I agree with our Prime Minister Theresa May. It
doesn’t matter if we in the UK love or hate many of Trump’s policies,
we can still work together. We should try to work with
everyone. Engagement is the British approach.</p>
<p>The UK has a powerful Navy, it is even more powerful when it works
with the US military. We all need to take out ISIS and other terrorist
groups.</p>
<p>We have complimentary economies, we can trade together. Trump has
criticised Mexico and China for taking American jobs. The UK is not
Mexico or China. Currencies are always changing but in January, the
figures were:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>US minimum wage: $7.25 per hour</p>
<p>UK minimum wage: $9.31 per hour</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So the minimum wage is higher in the UK than the US, we can trade
together for great mutual benefit with no risk of a race to the
bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-hysteria-is-somewhat-external">
<h2>14. The Hysteria is somewhat external</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/hulk.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/hulk.png"/>
<p>I am still asking for someone to tell me why President Trump is
uniquely more hysteria-inducing than his predecessors. Most
criticisms, valid or not, apply to a previous President or other.</p>
<p>It seems to me, the biggest difference between now and when President
Bush came into office in 2002, and especially between now and when
Reagan came into office in 1980, is the technological difference.</p>
<p>It was through better use of technology that allowed Donald Trump to
leapfrog the big corporate media companies and beat 16 other
candidates and the Democrats.</p>
<p>However, the same is true on the other side, that there is an echo
chamber provided by social media and the World Wide Web which seems to
magnify the hysteria.</p>
<p>Meanwhile email and the web give the ability to organise an event or
protest far more cheaply and efficiently than in the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-is-always-more-important">
<h2>15. Technology is always more important</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/unicron.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/unicron.jpg"/>
<p>2016 was a big year in politics but it is important to remember that
politics is merely a response to cultural change which is driven by
technological change. Politics is dealing with the
symptoms. Technology is the underlying cause.</p>
<p>The invention of the printing press allowed an information revolution
which led to the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and the Industrial
Revolution. The consequences continued for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, it was the final
piece that allowed a new information revolution to begin. President
Donald Trump and those opposing him are political results of this
revolution but they will not be the last. This thing will run for
hundreds of years.</p>
<p>As Sir Winston Churchill said, “Now this is not the end. It is not
even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the
beginning.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Leaving the EU in name only</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/sunrise.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/sunrise.jpg"/>
<p>I have never met a Leave voter who wanted to stay inside the Single
Market or Customs Union. Quite the opposite. It seems pretty clear to
me that leave the European Union means leave it.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-people-were-the-jury">
<h2>The people were the jury</h2>
<p>In order to secure re-election, the government offered an EU in-out
referendum in their May 2015 election manifesto.</p>
<p>Prime Minister David Cameron tried to do a last-ditch
compromise with the EU but it refused to offer any meaningful
concessions.</p>
<p>In the 13 months between election and referendum, those who wanted to
remain or leave the EU made their arguments in a campaign that (to me)
seemed to go on forever.</p>
<p>The whole point of a vote is that it was up to the British public to
decide who to believe, to act as a jury to judge whose arguments were
right and whose were wrong.</p>
<p>In a historic turnout, 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU, more
than have ever voted for anything before.</p>
<p>After the 13 months of the focus being on Brexit, I thought the vote
would decide it and the focus of the nation would move on to other
topics. No such luck.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cadaveric-spasms">
<h2>Cadaveric spasms</h2>
<p>Several politicians and prominent establishment figures on the remain
side of the argument have never accepted the result and have been
replaying the already too-long campaign all over again.</p>
<p>These establishment figures didn’t learn the most important lesson
from the campaign, that the population are not fools and are not
scared of doom scenarios.</p>
<p>Whenever such a figure says “I respect the result but” and then gives
a ‘project fear’ argument already previously rejected in the vote, it
shows they don’t actually respect the result.</p>
<p>After an initial attempt to get a re-run of the vote failed to gain
traction, they have moved on to try to re-define what leaving the EU
means so that Brexit becomes leaving the EU in name only. It is a
sleight of hand trick.</p>
<p>They started with ‘leaving the EU does not mean leaving the single
market’ but then News shows and Youtubers compiled clips of all the
major figures on both sides before the vote saying leaving the EU
would mean leaving the single market.</p>
<p>Now they are focusing on the ‘Staying in the Customs Union’ as if this
was some separate project. It is not, the Customs Union is the core of
the whole EU. If we stay in the Customs Union, we lose the biggest
advantage of Brexit, and for me personally, half of the point of doing
it at all.</p>
<p>That advantage is having Free Trade deals with the growing part of the
world. I talked more about this several times <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/12/02/occams_racists.html">including in my last post</a>.</p>
<p>In the following table I list 10 Countries that have publicly
approached the UK for a trade deal post-Brexit vote. There may be more
but these ten will prove the point.</p>

<p>While declining in importance, the remaining 27 countries of the EU
form an important market:</p>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>EU 27</td>
<td>18.432</td>
<td>435</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The GDP of these 10 countries that seek a trade deal with the UK have
a combined GDP three times larger than the EU 27 and a population 8
times larger. Almost all of these countries have higher GDP growth
than the EU.</p>
<p>Maintaining access to the single market is important, but many times
less important than gaining improved access to these 10 global
markets. The disparity gets wider every day and every year as the
developing world increases both its GDP and its population.</p>
<p>To join the EU, we had to throw away free trade deals that we already
had with many of these countries, so being stuck inside the Customs
Union has made us much poorer than we could have been, and staying
inside it in the future will certainly restrict the UK’s potential
economic growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leaving-twice">
<h2>Leaving Twice</h2>
<p>The raw economic numbers are clear, it is better to have a clean
Brexit and offer the EU a bi-lateral free trade deal. It is also nicer
to our European neighbours in the long run.</p>
<p>If the government goes with some compromised (‘soft’) form of Brexit
that stops the UK making free trade deals, including the power to
remove tariffs and agree common standards etc, then there will just be
a second round of Brexit.</p>
<p>The campaign to leave the EU really began in 1992, it took 24 years to
get enough momentum to win a referendum. The second round will not
take so long, we are mobilised and engaged already.</p>
<p>The UK already annoyed our partners by being in the EU but being
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/07/09/good_fences_make_good_neighbours.html">unhappy tenants</a> - we demanded a (partial) rebate and we refused to
join many of the recent programs such as the Euro, Schengen, etc.</p>
<p>We then voted to leave. If the government signs a deal with the EU in
2019 that includes staying within the Customs Union, but then five or
ten years later, the people vote to leave that too, we are throwing
away any remaining goodwill we have left.</p>
<p>So it much nicer to our European neighbours to leave once, rather than
mess them around by partially leaving and then leaving properly.</p>

<div class="section" id="follow-the-money">
<h2>Follow the money</h2>
<p>Those upset about Brexit like to see it as an isolated mistake that
came from nowhere.</p>
<p>This is not a random event. Most events are never isolated, and Brexit
is no different. It is a symptom of a wider trend.</p>
<p>Our exports to the EU have been falling since 2000 and especially
since the financial crash of 2008.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/graph.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/graph.png"/>
<p>Meanwhile our trade with the 84% of people that are not in the EU has
been growing.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an economic genius to work out why this has been
happening, the developing world has been booming, while the EU keeps
choosing job destroying policies and then when those jobs are gone,
uses the decline as an excuse to double down on nonsense and kill
some more jobs.</p>
<p>To pick a country almost at random, lets compare the Euro area to
India. The quarterly GDP growth of India is five times higher than the
Eurozone.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/quartgrowth.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/quartgrowth.png"/>
<p>This is not a recent trend. Lets look at the ten year graph:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/10year.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/10year.png"/>
<p>India’s growth is always higher than the Eurozone, look at 2011, India
can have a battle with Pakistan, risking Nuclear annihilation, and
still not go below the Euroarea’s growth.</p>
<p>This is not just a ten year trend, India has beaten European growth my
whole lifetime. It is repeated across the developing world. The
Eurozone has mostly flat or negative growth, while the developing
world keeps doubling its GDP to very surely catches up to our level of
wealth.</p>
<p>What these graphs show is that for the UK to maximise its wealth, we
have to get out there and be a global trading nation once again.</p>
<p>The 2008 crash showed that the square mile of the city of London
cannot pay for 65 million people. Since then we have just been running
our country on fumes, currency manipulation and denial. We are going
to have to use the whole of the UK and actually make and do things
again that people want to pay for.</p>
<p>There is a lot of spare supply side capacity in the Midlands and
North, and a lot of the human expertise is still there, grey and soon
to leave the workforce but available right now. Luckily, we are waking
up just in time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-remoaners-are-going-to-moan-for-a-generation">
<h2>The remoaners are going to moan for a generation</h2>
<p>I ended my post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/12/01/the_end_of_the_world_is_cancelled.html">The End of the World is Cancelled</a> saying that
Britain and Europe will get beyond Brexit and the relationship will be
better than ever.</p>
<p>We won’t have such luck with our domestic malcontents however. The
long-term inevitable and unavoidable trends above are totally ignored
by Europhiles. It is a zero-sum game where the growing 84% of the
world not in the EU don’t exist.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons for the professional remoaner class. Here
are a few of the most obvious ones:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>People are used to patronage from the EU. However, this was always
our money to start with, we can calm the nerves Universities and
Museums etc by stuffing their mouths full of gold. There is so much
waste and duplication in the EU that we can double the grants of
everyone and still be in profit.</li>
<li>EU salaries are often unbelievably good with endless handy perks. So
Brexit has cut off the easy career path for a lot of the
establishment who were expecting to upgrade to the European level:
judges, politicians, civil servants, policy wonks, etc.</li>
<li>EU elections happen between UK government elections, so for MPs, it
is handy backup option to become an MEP if you are unexpectedly get
kicked out by the voters. European elections are based on a list
system so it doesn’t matter how personally unpopular you have
become. Likewise minsters and high level civil servants can become
commissioners and so on.</li>
<li>Due to the above reduction in insider jobs, the private sector
revolving door has never been more powerful. The finance industry
has a lot of spare cash (time for more taxes?) and it hasn’t
demobilised from the Referendum campaign. MPs like Nick Clegg who
seem unlikely to keep their seat at the next election, are gearing
up for the next job. Just <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/797894120664604673">look how much cash</a> he is already taking

</ul>
<p>I could go on and on, but if you have read my post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/12/01/the_treaty_of_losers.html">The Treaty of
Losers</a>, you know I just cannot ignore the Occam’s Razor question
that is bugging me. Maybe it is nothing to do with these reasons
listed above, maybe it is much simpler and more obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Occam’s racists</h2>
<p>Until now, because the UK has been controlled by the EU, it could
never agree to anything with its Commonwealth allies, the Commonwealth
turned into a bit of a talking shop. However, it is turning back into
an important body now.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/commonwealth.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/commonwealth.jpg"/>
<p>As I talked about in previous posts, citizens of the Commonwealth
countries volunteered in their millions to fight and die for us in
World War II. Why wouldn’t everyone want to re-establish links with these
great countries?</p>
<p>Looking back at the first part of this post, we have everything to
gain. Who wouldn’t want to do trade deals with the massively growing
commonwealth economies?</p>
<p>The answer is the remainer politicians and the establishment experts,
who won’t even dare to discuss it. They bang on about having access to
a (declining) market of “500 million people” (which includes UK so it
is actually 435 million) but they never talk about the 2.3 billion
people in Commonwealth or the 6.5 billion in the non-EU rest of the
world.</p>
<p>Is this because it will just undermine their argument or is there
something simpler going on?</p>
<p>Look back at the Commonwealth Heads of State, now look at the EU leaders:</p>

<p>In my previous posts, I talked about the importance of us as a country
getting involved in the Commonwealth countries. Luckily we have an
opening. The Commonwealth countries are still there and they want to
work with us, with a bit of humility, the former masters can become
the servants. There is a lot of goods, services and expertise we can
provide to help the continued development of their countries.</p>
<p>My main point throughout my Brexit posts is that I do not believe that
having a bilateral trade arrangement with EU rather than being a
member is Armageddon.</p>
<p>Indeed, when we are finally free of the stifling customs union, we can
really target improved relations with the rest of the
world. Especially the Commonwealth which is now 2.3 billion people and
most of world growth, as well as the United States and anyone else who
wants to come with us in global free but fair trade.</p>

<p>There is a lot of bluster from the EU, but that is for domestic
consumption and deflect from the fact that national leaders in the EU
Council of Ministers thought it could ignore British’s demands for
reforms and the British people wouldn’t call its bluff. It did and now
we have to move on. There is no going back.</p>
<p>On almost every issue, the EU needs UK more than UK needs the EU.</p>

<p>European nations and companies rely on finance from the city of London
and they sell to us a lot more than we sell to them.</p>
<p>If the EU does not give tariff free access to the EU, the UK will
retaliate in kind. The EU has already lost a lot of jobs due to
putting sanctions on Russia, many areas of Europe will be equally
badly hit if this happens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have a free floating currency, we can win any tariff war
by devaluing the pound. The Bank of England can buy back government
debt through quantitative easing. Our exports become cheaper, removing
the effect of the EU’s tariff, the government has less debt and
domestic production becomes more competitive. Triple win.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside the customs union, we can substitute almost any EU
product with far cheaper global imports. South African or Australian
wine might not initially have the same brand power as French wine but
it still gets you drunk, and fashion is not a one way street, they can
also move to meet the circumstances.</p>

<p>UK is the main military power of Europe. European leaders know if they
anger the British public so much that defending EU countries becomes
politically impossible, then how will it defend itself from Putin’s
next adventure?</p>
<p>Meanwhile The EU does not have the money to create an equivalent force
and it takes a long time to make the martial culture required to be
effective. In Afghanistan, the German troops refused to leave base
without British guards. Putin’s men have no such scruples.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-nation-of-immigrants">
<h2>A nation of immigrants</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/deli.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/deli.jpg"/>
<p>Ignoring the Irish people who are unaffected by Brexit due to
pre-existing and ancient rights, there are three million great and
mostly young people working in Britain from other EU countries. It is
going up not down since Brexit. Due to the relative economic strength
of the UK.</p>
<p>Those from Eastern Europe send remittances back to their families
which is spent in local shops, this is quite important to the economy
of many Eastern Europe countries.</p>
<p>Whereas the largest proportion of the one million British people in
Europe are retired people in the Sun. On the whole, these seniors
don’t need working rights, they don’t take the jobs, they just shop,
eat and drink, providing essential extra income into otherwise quite
fragile seaside areas.</p>
<p>We can offer whatever terms we want or don’t want. It doesn’t matter,
the EU will have to accept them.</p>
<p>The EU deals with both trade and immigration so with Brexit it is all
mixed up, however normally immigration shouldn’t actually have that much
to do with a trade deal.</p>
<p>We haven’t sent people back to Europe since we beat the viking horde,
we won’t start again now. We never had much immigration control
against Europeans, I doubt anyone will notice that much of a
difference after Brexit. Whatever tests we set (getting to that in a
just a second), most people who want to come here will pass them.</p>
<p>The UK government always makes a meaningless immigration target, but
that is not important. If we engage more with the 84% of the world
that we have been mostly ignoring, then the booming economy will
need more labour.</p>
<p>What people want is control. Post-Brexit immigration system needs to
have the following features:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Vet and interview people coming from terrorist hotspots so we don’t
take in any more terrorists. Throw out existing known terrorists.</li>
<li>Pick the best and brightest people we can find from the whole world.</li>
<li>Treat everyone equally, i.e. don’t discriminate based on race, more
on that in a future post.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once immigration has a defensible system, it will stop being a
political football and people will stop worrying about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-will-all-be-fine">
<h2>It will all be fine</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/eurostar.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/eurostar.jpg"/>
<p>Since we joined the EU, we outsourced most of the important decisions
to Brussels but the employee count of Whitehall and the rest of the
British government did not get smaller, it just kept increasing. So
over 30 years this increasingly pointless, bloated and atrophied class
of bureaucrats is used to being told what to do.</p>
<p>Now these bureaucrats are panicking because finally they have to take
some responsibility and do some work. Like an unused muscle it is
providing resistance and some of it might be dead weight.</p>
<p>If I was a government department I would be showing how useful I am to
the process of creating new UK systems. Obstructions might find
themselves being worked around and replaced.</p>
<p>Assuming the government can provide leadership and overcome this
addiction to sloth, Brexit is going to be fine.</p>
<p>It is interesting how the government created a new department for
Brexit and a new department for International Trade. A new broom can
clean best.</p>
<p>A full Brexit will finally lance the boil of frustration over Europe
and allow us all to get on with things. As I said before in my post
“<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/07/09/good_fences_make_good_neighbours.html">Good fences make good neighbours</a>”, Britain will go from being an
unhappy tenant of the EU to Europe’s most supportive neighbour and
ally.</p>
<p>We will get a workable free trade deal. The rest of Europe will get
over it, indeed Britain never joined the Euro, Schengen, Fiscal
Compact and dozens of other things, so in a decade, people in Europe
will have forgotten that the UK was ever a member.</p>
<p>No such luck with our own domestic moaners, they will go on for a
generation. More on that later.</p>

<p>Whenever a European Union politician wanted to dismiss the UK’s input
from a decision, it would always bring up that it is not one of the
“<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Six">Inner Six</a>” who are the ones who should have the final say. What
is common about the Inner Six is that they were either all Axis
countries or surrendered at the first major German offensive. They are
really the “Inner Losers” of World War II.</p>

<p>In this signing ceremony, they are meeting on the Capitoline Hill, the
very centre of the Roman Empire. This symbolism is not to be
ignored. They specifically chose to wrap this new Union in the
symbolism of the previous attempts to unite the peoples of Europe (
see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs the Matrix</a> for a lot more on this topic).</p>
<p>This treaty of signed by War dodgers of the Axis countries that just
lost World War II, yet in their head they Roman emperors.</p>
<div class="section" id="union-of-europeans">
<h2>Union of Europeans</h2>
<p>The EU traces its origin to this Treaty of Rome, the first line is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>DETERMINED to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of
Europe,</div></blockquote>
<p>On that same first page, we have a resolution “to eliminate the
barriers which divide Europe” and to ensure “harmonious development”
by “reducing the differences existing between the various regions”. It
goes on in much the same way for 80 pages.</p>
<p>The implication of it all is that Europeans are a single people
accidentally separated by borders and they should fix it with an ever
closer union.</p>
<p>In my post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs the Matrix</a>, I talked about how from Roman times
until today, they have been trying to reunite Continental Europe.</p>
<p>The most immediate pre-brexit example is of course Hitler’s attempt to
unify Europe in a Nazi Empire which I talked about in the
post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/11/06/godwin_part_two.html">Godwin part two</a>.</p>
<p>In short, the all white master race lost to the multi-racial armies of
the Allies.</p>
<p>Both the Nazi empire and the EU follow an atheistic secular scientific
approach, with religion and Christian culture pushed deep out of
public life.</p>
<p>Most importantly they both use Roman era symbolism for their ends. The
EU is a Union of White majority countries, with a customs union of
external tariffs seeking to partially insulate the European economies
from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>If you are from Bulgaria or Finland, you have freedom of movement to
work and live into the UK, but if you are from Kenya or India, you do
not. The former countries are white European countries, the latter are
not. <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#the-question-that-remain-will-never-answer">I am not the only one who spotted this</a>.</p>
<p>Mein Kampf is written by a deranged socialist artist who became a
dictator. The treaty of Rome is written by lawyers. However, they both
have this concept of a United European people, both times they have a
white majority, how convenient.</p>
<p>The deep pool of racism that led the Axis populations to condone
Hitler didn’t magically disappear when the allied soldiers rolled
in.</p>
<p>This concept of a unified European people is the middle-class educated
lawyer’s version of a master race. Once you understand this, all the
white supremacist euphemisms used knowingly and unknowingly by
Europhiles become clear.</p>
<p>For myself, I don’t believe in this concept of a special united
European people. I think someone from South Africa or Pakistan is
equal to someone from Finland or Slovakia. We should work with
everyone and not put up barriers to the 84% of humanity that are not
in the EU, we should be equally open to everyone.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Godwin part two</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/augustus.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/augustus.png"/>
<p>I had meant to write a sequel to my 2007 <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/archive/2007/06/27/archimedes-why-godwin-was-wrong/">post on Godwin’s
law</a>. Over, ten years later, here I am.</p>
<p>The book Mein Kampf is the demented ravings of Hitler. It comes in two
parts. The first volume is an autobiography and the second is his
manifesto of National Socialism and his plan for a “new order”, which
later he had an opportunity to try out.</p>
<p>Hitler’s philosophy was socialist in that he aimed to abolish
individualism. He believed this process should begin from birth, and
children should be educated in a system of total control, that
minimises parental influence in favour of the ideas of the Nazi state.</p>
<p>The book also spends time explaining Hitler’s atheism, and his desire
to remove Christianity from all public society. Obviously I don’t need
to explain his views toward Jews. Hitler believed in pre-Christian
neo-pagan style beliefs with his famous vegetarianism. He believed the
pre-Christian Roman Era under Julius Caesar and Emperor Augustus was
the high point of humanity.</p>
<p>Hitler believed in allying with certain Christian groups if it suited
his strive for power, at least until after he had created his empire
then he could totally abolish it.</p>
<p>For Hitler, Christianity is a Jewish plot to keep Europeans from
understanding their true ancient “Aryan identity”, their natural
superiority from being white and more highly evolved. Everyone else,
including Slavic peoples, were Untermensch, subhumans.</p>
<p>Albert Speer, quoted Hitler in his book Inside the Third Reich:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“You see, it’s been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why
didn’t we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice
for the fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion
too would have been much more compatible to us than
Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness
and flabbiness?”</div></blockquote>
<p>Instead of a heavenly Kingdom, Hitler believed it was his destiny to
create a united Europe with himself at the centre. A new Roman Empire,
with himself as Emperor. An Empire without meat, smoking or alcohol.</p>
<p>When George Orwell reviewed the book for a magazine, he called
Hilter’s vision of a united Europe: “a horrible brainless empire”.</p>
<p>His atheistic secular scientific approach did mean he spent an
enormous sum on Universities and research and development. Which is
why at the end of World War 2, the allies raced with each other to
grab all the Nazi scientists.</p>
<p>However, Nazi Germany couldn’t get many of their innovations into
production in time to help prevent the total loss to the Allies. As it
turned out, this master race of white Europeans wasn’t as good as it
thought it was.</p>
<p>As I talked about in the previous posts, it is important not to forget
how diverse the Allied armies were. The white European master race
lost to the mixed multi-racial British Empire army, the segregated
multi-racial American army and the Slavic Soviet army.</p>
<p>People are just people. There is no white superiority, if there was
Hitler would have won the Second World War. There is no need to repeat
the monstrous experiment.</p>
<p>How socialist National Socialism actually was is one of those issues
to be debated forever.</p>
<p>The ambition to abolish Christianity is always the hallmark of
authoritarianism, likewise the desire for the state to indoctrinate
children instead of letting parents teach children their own ideas.</p>
<p>More superficially, whenever a vegetarian or teetotaler imposes their
policy on the majority, I think of Hitler’s plan for his eventual
joyless Empire.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/clintonwikileaks.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/clintonwikileaks.png"/>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> has once again come up with some fantastic insights into how
the elite run the world. Reading the different leaks from people
associated with Hillary Clinton is fascinating. We are really getting
a deep view into the globalist mindset.</p>
<p>The emails showing <a class="reference external" href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#efmAIuAMKAViAXv">what Hillary was promising to her wall street donors</a> are
particularly enlightening.</p>
<p>If her actions and choices seem incomprehensible, you have understand
that Clinton and her friends have a very different view of the world
than us normal people. Especially those of us who hold to romantic
ideas like God and country and loving your neighbours as yourself.</p>
<p>As always, click to enlarge the images.</p>

<p>If you think that Hillary’s best known house, the house in Chappaqua,
is pretty reserved and tasteful for the elite, it is, but you have to
remember that this is not a ranch in the middle of the Texan desert,
it is at the end of a private road in the suburbs of New York City. It
is a mega-great house.</p>

<p>The house is surrounded by a large white wall, and a manned guardhouse
stands by the entrance to the property. Yes, the anti-wall Clinton
likes her own walls very much.</p>
<p>The red barn at the back is not for chickens, it is where her
household staff and armed security are hidden away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a small fleet of armoured vehicles provide suitable
transport for any occasion.</p>

<p>In 2016 figures, the <a class="reference external" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A229RX0">per capita disposable income</a> of an American
citizen is $39,190. Chelsea Clinton went to a school where tuition and
fees cost $48,160 in 2016/2017. And yes, it has a massive green campus
with a giant fence around it. The school campus makes Clinton’s house
look like a hovel.</p>
<p>If Hillary doesn’t care about what provision is needed to handle mass
immigration to inner cities, it is partly because she doesn’t need to
use the overwhelmed schools or local services herself.</p>
<p>If Hillary seems a bit disrespectful towards the police, it is because
she doesn’t need them, she has her own armed guards.</p>
<p>We can go on like this forever, so lets zoom out a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="different-map">
<h2>Different Map</h2>
<p>Almost every country has at least one thing to be proud of. As the
British people, we are proud of our hard won freedoms and the communal
institutions that our ancestors left us such as the NHS, our Royal
Navy, our Royal family, our state school system, our ancient churches,
castles, national parks and so on.</p>
<p>This means nothing to Hillary and their tribe, they are globalists
because they are so rich they don’t want or need a nation state to
look after them. From the first class cabin and the private jet, every
country looks the same, the same hotel chains, the same exclusive
shops, etc. The rich already live in a generic border free world.</p>

<h2>How to run the world</h2>
<p>The power structures of the globalist world view are really
interesting but also quite basic. There are four levers they have to
control the world. I will explain this using the above map.</p>

<p>To Hillary and her ilk, California is the capital of the world,
eventually drawing all of the Americas into a “greater California”.</p>
<p>By combining this Reino de Clintoñia with its two major colonies of
Eurabia and Pacifica, we have a giant and generic service economy,
ready to serve the elite’s every desire.</p>
<p>All the trade agreements like TTIP, TPP and the EU are there to make
sure the servants do not become too uppity and to remove any barriers
to the maximisation of profits for Goldman Sachs bankers and the
others who fund Clinton and her friends.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Patronage</li>
</ol>
<p>As well as unifying the legal and trade systems, patronage is used to
keep potentially dangerous alternate power structures such as
intellectuals, religion and the media on board. Internal ‘markets’ and
competition for grants keep the universities, NGOs and charities as
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">useful idiots</a> spreading the globalist gospel.</p>
<p>It is important to create pseudo-scientific pretences of why this
globalist neo-feudal system benefits the population more generally, as
opposed to more Occam’s razor like solutions such as lets take the
rich’s wealth away and use it to cure cancer.</p>
<p>This is also why the current move towards cultural Marxism and
identity politics suits the elite so well. David Cameron and the
American democrat/republican one party state are happy to hand out gay
marriage because it doesn’t cost them any money. Here <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrwcS4n1kzQ">have all the pronouns you want</a>,
just don’t ask for decent housing for the poor, infrastructure or services.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Consumer goods and entertainment</li>
</ol>
<p>2000 years ago, the Roman writer Juvenal coined the phrase ‘panem et
circenses’ (bread and circuses) to explain how the elite kept the
masses under control.</p>
<p>The classical theory of why the Roman empire fell includes the
observation that through insecurity of trade routes and inflation,
Rome stopped being able to provide affordable consumer goods to the
people.</p>
<p>The global leaders today do not make the same mistake, they keep their
servant class in check by exploiting the poor of the world. They keep
Chinese goods cheap, and if the Chinese get sick of making plastic
crap for the world, they keep plenty of other Asian countries poor as
a backup, after that there is Africa, which is currently just used as
a giant shop of minerals to be exploited.</p>
<p>[I have talked a lot lately in this blog about how Africa bears the
brunt of the current system of world trade, so I don’t want to sound
like a broken record, needless to say, every trade deal they make
always includes massive tariffs against Sub-Saharan African
countries.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are in an entertainment golden age, no end of TV shows,
films and sports are provided to keep the minds of the servants
busy. While there is an attempt to reclaim costs to pay the cast and
crew and so on, unauthorised distribution of media is rampant and
tolerated as only thing worse than the people watching unauthorised TV
is the people not watching it.</p>
<p>If the mainstream media is rejected by the people, then a major form
of control is lost, thus the mad dash to control and censor the Web.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Useful enemy</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever Clinton and other Western politicians get into trouble,
Russia and a few other useful enemies are wheeled out as a useful
excuse for pretty much anything.</p>
<p>There is a Goldilocks zone for useful enemies, not too big and not too
small, Putin was getting too big for his boots so sanctions were used
to make Russia’s GDP smaller than Australia, meanwhile Iran was on the
verge of total collapse so Obama and Clinton recently removed its
sanctions and bailed out the regime with billions of dollars.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="another-way">
<h2>Another way</h2>
<p>We are finally at a level of technology where we can in our lifetimes,
foresee a future free of disease, want or waste, where robots do the
work and people are free.</p>
<p>After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, when FDR decided to pursue a war
across two oceans, the US had no ability to fight a major foreign war
on one front, let alone two. Yet he pulled everyone together, rich and
poor, black and white, and together they got the job done.</p>
<p>Setting a national goal and putting the resources of the whole society
into it can achieve massive things:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the
goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to earth.”</div></blockquote>
<p>When JFK said the above quote, they had a general idea of the physical
principles but no practical clue how to achieve it. We now know far
more about cancer and other diseases than we knew about the moon
in 1961.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we will commit ourselves to curing cancer in
ten years, to curing type 1 diabetes, to ending asthma in children.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we are going to digitise our cars so that in
five years time, the number of child deaths on the road is 0.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we will build a house for every person who
needs one, even if we have to take away a little land from wealthy
estates.</p>

<h2>What is not important</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/disapprove.png"><img alt="../../../_images/disapprove-small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/disapprove-small.png"/></a>
<p>The whole reality TV side of things I don’t really care about. I don’t
care if Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t wear a tie or Boris Johnson has made
inappropriate jokes about foreign dictators. I don’t care if Labour MPs
feel unhappy with Corbyn’s management style or Theresa May is
alienating the 48% (which is now more like the 13% according to the
latest polling but lets not get off track).</p>
<p>I do think it is somewhat odd that almost all of the Labour shadow
cabinet come from London while almost all of the Tory Cabinet come
from the home counties, but if they were the best people they could
get, then I guess I don’t care.</p>
<p>I don’t care if Trump said something sexist 20 years ago, I don’t care
if he makes his staff lose weight, I don’t care what he did when we
was a billionaire playboy and a businessman.</p>
<p>I don’t care that the Clintons have a weird open marriage where, to
use Hillary’s own terminology, she has to herd around Bill’s discarded
‘bimbos’. I don’t care how much Hillary swears in her emails. I
don’t care she called her own party “a bucket of losers.” I don’t care
if she coughs constantly for 8 years in a row.</p>
<p>I don’t care about temperament, I don’t care about who is the best
manager. I don’t care who is the best husband or wife or mother or
father.</p>
<p>I just want them to put these lilliputian tabloid issues aside and
have some real policies to do something worthwhile for the actual
voters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="champions-not-tokens">
<h2>Champions not tokens</h2>
<p>The lives of the elite and the normal people are divided as never
before. However, we don’t need leaders who feign the common touch. We
don’t want token leaders, we want champions of the people.</p>
<p>Churchill was born into vast wealth, he was a drunk who gambled away
the wealth of two great families and said many outrageous and sexist
things, he would have probably been called deplorable and irredeemable
by Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>However, Churchill put all his privileged background and personal
contacts into one aim, being the best military leader he could be.</p>
<p>When the time came that Britain was in the existential crisis of World
War II, Churchill, being friends or related to much of the elite, knew
exactly where their money was. The rich did not get off easy in cash
terms and many of the Lordly estates were broken up. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/land-requisitioned-war/">According to the
national archives</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“a total of 14.5 million acres of land, 25 million square feet of
industrial and storage premises and 113,350 holdings of non-industrial
premises were requisitioned by the State.”</div></blockquote>
<p>If we can raid the rich to defeat Hitler, can’t we raid them again to
defeat cancer?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Stylish Super Skulk</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/firefox1.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/firefox1.jpg"/>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2014/01/12/installing_multiple_versions_of_firefox.html">last time I talked about the web browser</a>, I was technically
speaking about Iceweasel. For the last decade, Linux users like me
have known the default browser that Debian ships under the name of
Iceweasel.</p>
<p>In 2006, due to some hysteria over trademark protection and typical
West Coast America “we know better than you” attitude, Mozilla told
Debian it could not use the name Firefox or the Firefox logo.</p>
<p>Can we even use it here? Well since we don’t want to be told off by
Mozilla’s logo police, we can use images of some beautiful people who
have made their own dramatic and artistic costume interpretations of
the logo. This blog is 90% about cool and silly pictures after all.</p>
<p>After 10 years of Debian using the name Iceweasel and its own logo,
eventually, Mozilla <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815006">gave up and asked Debian to use the normal name and logo</a>.
Lets celebrate with another costume:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/firefox2.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/firefox2.jpg"/>
<p>Thanks Iceweasel for your service, we will miss you. LWM published
<a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/676799/">a longer discussion of this change</a>. Incidentally, Google’s Browser is
still called Chromium instead of Chrome on the Debian Linux
platform. I could only find one Chrome costume:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/chrome.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/chrome.jpg"/>
<p>He (or she) looks pretty happy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this week Firefox 48 has been released which, among other
things, has caught up with a feature that Chromium has had for a while,
namely multiple processes.</p>
<p>Making the browser render web content or play media in a subprocess is
obviously a win for security and performance, especially on Liunx.</p>
<p>Processes are the main native form of efficient resource allocation on
Linux, so now Firefox is using multiple processes it is finally
working with the grain rather against it.</p>
<p>It is still early days. Nothing has crashed for me yet, but I am
keeping the Firefox that Debian distributes (which at time of writing
is version 45), around just in case. You might want to consider doing
the same, especially if you are using extensions which may not work in
the multiprocess mode yet.</p>
<p>To try it out, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/">download Firefox</a>. By the way in my <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2014/01/12/installing_multiple_versions_of_firefox.html">last post about
Firefox</a>, I talked about how to run multiple Versions of Firefox and
how to create an extra profile, which might be handy.</p>
<p>Firefox is pretty cautious about turning multiprocess mode on but
putting <a class="reference external" href="about:status">about:status</a> into the browser will tell you if it is on or
off. As in the image below:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/firefox.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/firefox.png"/>
<p>If you find it is off, you can make a new profile (as I just
mentioned) or you can open <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a> and toggle the setting called
browser.tabs.remote.autostart to true. Then you can go back to
<a class="reference external" href="about:status">about:status</a> and see if it worked.</p>
<p>It still might be off because of whatever reason, i.e. they it might
break an extension or whatever. If you want to push on anyway then you
have to open <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a> again and make a new boolean setting called
browser.tabs.remote.force-enable and set that to true. Find more
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis#Firefox_Release">instructions here</a>.</p>
<p>So well done to all the Mozilla developers and volunteers who wrote
and shipped that. Just for you, another of those great Firefox
costumes:</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/falklands3.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/falklands3.jpg"/>
<div class="section" id="those-who-resort-to-violence-always-lose-their-claim">
<h2>Those who resort to violence, always lose their claim</h2>
<p>After the 18th and 19th centuries, there were many competing
territorial claims over former Prussia; Germany had some valid and
some not so valid claims, as did other countries. Going to war (twice)
over the claims was not valid however.</p>
<p>It is a long standing and basic principle of world order that
the belligerent aggressor loses whatever claims they had. Now of
course Germany is a peaceful and wonderful country and also makes no
claim to any of these areas.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/germany.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/germany.jpg"/>
<p>Whatever the right or wrongs of the Falklands issue were before 1982,
once Argentina invaded and spilt British blood, they lost any claim to
the islands; it is just how it goes.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/falklands2.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/falklands2.jpg"/>
<p>It is also an issue of basic democracy that as recently as 2013, the
Falkland Islanders had a referendum with a turnout of 91.94%, where
99.8% voted not to change the Islands’ status in anyway. The results
of referendums must be respected, especially with such a high turnout.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/falklands.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/falklands.jpg"/>
<p>There is also the practical matter that saying anything different will
be a sure loser in British election.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/israel4.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/israel4.jpg"/>
<p>Likewise, the question of whether making the state of Israel was the
correct response to the evil of the holocaust, became a non-issue
after 1967. Israel did not start the war, the Arabs did, but the
Israelis won the war and the issue was settled.</p>
<p>Any claims the Arabs had over the land was lost then. You don’t get to
claim territory through starting wars, you must only lose by starting
wars.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-to-boycott-calling-for-boycotts">
<h2>Time to boycott calling for boycotts</h2>
<p>Even if you disagree with Israel’s policies, collective punishment
against its citizens can have no practical effect on those policies.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/israel3-small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/israel3-small.jpg"/>
<p>Dis-inviting an innocent academic from a conference, will not change
policy. A professor of Artificial Intelligence or Manuscript Studies
(made up examples for the sake of argument) does not set Israeli
security or foreign policy.</p>
<p>If a UK institution chose an Israeli company to provide a product, it
did so based on price and quality. Pressuring an institution to
boycott the Israeli company will just make innocent workers there
poorer and will mean the UK institution will get a higher priced
and/or lower quality good. An orange juice producer or a software
company does not set Israeli security or foreign policy.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/israel5.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/israel5.jpg"/>
<p>The same principle applies to exports. Pressuring a UK company to not
sell products to Israel, tractors for example, will not change a
single Israeli policy. It will just mean they buy a tractor from
someone else and workers in the UK have less jobs making tractors.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/israel2.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/israel2.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discretion-is-the-better-part-of-valour">
<h2>Discretion is the better part of valour</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/beach.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/beach.jpg"/>
<p>The sad truth is that there is nothing the UK can usefully do to make
peace in the middle east. Tony Blair of all people tried to be a peace
envoy and yet there is still no peace.</p>
<p>Any politicians that want to pander to either Muslim or Jewish voters
by taking a side are just being dishonest with the voters. The UK just
has no leverage on either side. The Middle East is just not a part of
the world that cares what Britain thinks one way or the other.</p>
<p>Our winning strategy as a country is not to pick sides and just be a
friend to everyone, and of course, sell them all our goods and
services.</p>
<p>By the way, America has far more clout, expertise and money and still
has not made much progress either but that is another story.</p>
<p>Yes there are poor and suffering people in the Middle East, but there
are poor and suffering people everywhere so we should focus on areas
where we are wanted and we can have a meaningful impact, such as
African free trade and development which we have ignored for too long.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-is-not-our-fight">
<h2>It is not our fight</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/surf.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/surf.jpg"/>
<p>So it total baffles me why Palestinian liberation or Latin American
politics are cause celebres on the UK left. There are no votes to be
won here.</p>
<p>We talked before about the difference between few hundred thousand
people in the UK who have strong political views and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/08/02/let_them_eat_cake.html">millions who just want cake</a>.</p>
<p>The average British voter does not care a monkeys about Palestine or
improving Anglo-Argentinean relations and just wants to hear domestic
policies.</p>
<p>It seems like Jeremy Corbyn is wise enough to know that there is a
difference in being a backbench MP who can obsess about these obscure
issues and a potential Prime Minister who needs to have total clarity
and focus to cut through a hostile media. I hope so anyway.</p>

<p>On the 23rd June 2016, the people of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland were asked whether they wanted to leave or remain in the
European Union. 52% voted to leave while 48% voted to remain.</p>
<p>On April 10th 2016, ten weeks before the vote, ICM published <a class="reference external" href="https://www.icmunlimited.com/polls/">an opinion poll</a>
that gave a four-point lead for Leave (52% vs 48%), which turned out
to be the correct result.</p>
<p>One explanation is that with several pollsters covering the
referendum, one has to be right; after all, even a stopped clock is
correct twice a day.</p>
<p>However, lets consider an alternative explanation, that the whole EU
referendum campaign made absolutely no difference to public opinion at
all.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of pounds spent by the campaigns, posters,
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/07/02/order_of_magnitude.html">Boris’ bus slogan</a>, acres of newspaper columns,
billions and trillions of tweets, all of it, didn’t manage to
convince anyone of anything.</p>
<p>People are just not that into politics.</p>
<p>In other words, the day to day minutiae of events doesn’t really
matter to the silent majority, they haven’t got the time or the
inclination to care and why should they? It would be very conceited to
say the people should look up and spend their time listening to their
Lords and masters.</p>
<p>The print circulation of Britain’s main broadsheet newspapers has
fallen so far they can barely scrape a million per day combined. What
percentage of their remaining readers do more than browse the news
before going straight to the crossword or the sport section?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, less than 200,000 people in the UK watch the BBC’s political
programmes, but over 15 million people watch ‘The Great British Bake
Off’ on the same network, which is a cake baking competition.</p>
<p>As I <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/748914202933391360">said on Twitter</a>: Politics is important. However, cakes are 75
times more important.</p>
<p>In fact, I don’t want to ever live in a country where politics is more
important than cake, it doesn’t sound like a very benevolent regime.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hope Wins over Fear</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/lloyd.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/lloyd.jpg"/>
<p>In the midst of a larger post about the results of the EU referendum,
I talked about the <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#echo-chamber">echo chamber</a> in the campaign. I want to explore
that a tiny bit more.</p>
<p>You also may remember that in a post before the referendum, I talked
about myself as an undergraduate and how I was <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html#party1999">very passionately
pro-EU</a> but over time, the doubts set in, especially after the crash
in 2008 and the EU’s harsh measures metered out to Greece.</p>
<p>As I started 2016, the doubts and problems with the EU had not yet
pushed me into the idea that the UK should ever leave the EU; I
started 2016 as a reluctant but firm ‘remanian’.</p>
<p>However, I wanted to make the decision based on all the information
and up to date arguments. I turned to other people, both on Twitter
and in the real world.</p>
<p>I soon ran into a problem, even discussing my own doubts was beyond
the pale with anyone pro-EU, you must support the EU because that is
what you do.</p>
<p>On Twitter it was worse, loudly unfollowed by 20-30 people, regularly
blocked in the middle of a seemingly civil discussion over a technical
EU matter.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/gollum.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/gollum.jpg"/>
<p>I was shocked the first time, saddened the second time, third time it
was water off a duck’s back, I stopped noticing or caring when someone
threw their toys out of the pram.</p>
<p>I did try to carrying on to discuss with any remainian who wanted to,
in the hope they would come up with the magic argument that would put
me squarely back in the remain camp. It soon became apparent that
everyone else has the same doubts and concerns.</p>
<p>Unlike ten years ago where you could easily encounter British
Europhiles who wanted to join the Euro and the Schengen Area and so
on, now ardent Europhiles seem a bit thin on the ground.</p>
<p>I met no-one that had a positive view of the EU as a force that will
make things better, it was just what you did about the faults, whether
you just lived with them in a fatalistic fashion or tried to face up
to them by leaving (and potentially making a lot of new
issues/opportunities).</p>
<p>A lot of the remain argument was that uneducated and poor people want
to leave, so don’t be in that group since they are all racists and
bigots. Well I was brought up in very modest circumstances indeed and
these are my people and I don’t recognise that description.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the leavers were just more fun and upbeat people. They were
happy to listen, discuss and gently point out their views.</p>
<p>I guess the morals of the story are that if you want to campaign for
something, have the most hopeful message. Even if you are against
something, have the best plan for fixing or replacing or leaving it
behind. Blocking people doesn’t win votes in real elections.</p>
<p>Above all, the moral is Twitter is probably a crap place for
discussing politics.</p>

<p>The EEC was not very popular when the government took the UK into it in
1973 and so the government was forced by the voters to have its first
leaving referendum only two years later in 1975.</p>

<p>The government and all of the media threw the kitchen sink at remain in
and succeeded, but on practical grounds alone, it never even tried to
sell the vision of an ever closer union to the people of Britain, and
if it had, it would have been rejected.</p>
<p>While governments managed to resist another referendum for the next
four decades, the practical nature of the remain argument meant there
was no mandate for further integration, indeed the remain argument was
won precisely on the basis that Britain would not be pulled in any
deeper.</p>
<p>So as the EU project developed in different directions, Europe was not
something Britain did, Europe was something done to it; something that
had to resisted or opted-out of: Schengen Area, the Eurozone and
countless other programmes.</p>
<p>The 2016 EU referendum was the the last moment in history that a
pro-EU case could be credibly made but again the establishment decided
not to make it. It again decided to focus on the perceived practical
shortcomings of an independent UK.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence2.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/fence2.jpg"/>
<p>In other countries, there are some people who genuinely believe in a
United States of Europe. However, <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">we in the UK never had that
tradition</a>, so those arguing for remain are those who benefit most
from the patronage that results from laundering our own taxes to and
from Brussels give.</p>
<p>Brussels is awash with lobbyists for non-European interests and
yesterdays winners struggling with technological change, wanting to
game the regulations against new interests.</p>
<p>Remain was a coalition between decent people wanting to keep the
status quo but also all these aforementioned parasites and spivs who
know they could not justify a policy or an item of government spending
to the British electorate so abuse the (still not very democratic) EU
to sidestep democracy to push their own special interests and
regulations.</p>
<p>I <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">said before the referendum</a> that the rationale for entering the EU
in 1973 was marginal at best and I concluded the forces moving the UK
away from it <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html#enter-the-matrix">were increasing</a>.</p>
<p>The neo-liberal/Thacherite consensus of the last 30 years cracked
fatally in the 2008 crash, since then it has been on life support as
near infinite supplies of money are printed and dished out to the
banks, but brain activity has not returned to the patient. The EU
referendum is the British people starting to turn the machine off.</p>
<p>To put it another way, as I said <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/750044741073592320">on Twitter</a>, it was Chekhov’s
referendum. David Cameron put a gun on stage and the people shot him
with it.</p>
<p>After the vote, I talked about the call for the second referendum and
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#second-referendum">why it will not work</a>, Brexit has just sped up the inevitable
changes.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence3.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/fence3.jpg"/>
<p>Anyway Britain is leaving the EU. If you voted for remain, not only
will be much happier if you just accept it and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/750323410979397632">move on with your life</a>,
you will be more successful. Escaping to a fantasyland where the vote
did not happen will mean you miss the opportunities of the future.</p>
<p>This applies to organisations and sections of the economy too, after
all no one is owed a living.</p>
<p>Those that work in harmony with the new independent era will thrive,
those that mope around re-fighting yesterday’s narrative will be seen
as irrelevant in the post-Brexit era and thus will lose funding
accordingly.</p>
<p>The leave supporting public has been gracious in victory, trying to
bring everyone on board. However, the good mood will not last long if
institutions are seen to be working against the UK. David Cameron and
George Osborne doubled-down on Remain and their position was untenable
in the new era. Those that don’t learn the lesson might suffer the
same fate.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence4.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/fence4.jpg"/>
<p>I think in the long term, Brexit will be a benefit to all of Europe,
Britain has gone from being an unhappy tenant of the EU to Europe’s
most supportive neighbour and ally.</p>
<p>If you are a European, we the British people, voted to take by control
and run our country from Westminster and our city councils and
regional parliaments in the UK. However, we still love you as people
and we love your countries. We can still kiss you from over the fence.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/borisbus.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/borisbus.jpg"/>
<p>The leave side had Boris’s battle bus which had the slogan “We send
the EU £350 million a week, let’s fund our NHS instead.”</p>
<p>While it is technically true that the cost of the UK’s soon to be
ended EU membership is £350 million per week, we got a rebate (i.e. a
discount) of £100 million so we only sent £250 million per week. While
it is not stated in the slogan how much exactly extra money could be
available for our NHS, it cannot be £350 million per week, since only
£250 million per week ever existed (to the extent that money exists).</p>
<p>For me, the question of whether to be in the EU or not was never about
money but the slogan would have worked as well with whatever the
correct fact-checked figure is.</p>
<p>However, if it was meant to be a trap, it worked. The remain side had
far more money and far more establishment figures, and when it
constantly sent those figures out to say that the real number is
really £250 million per week and some of this is spent on useful
things here in the UK etc, it is made leave’s case for it.</p>
<p>For £250 million a week is still a massive number and the same order
of magnitude, by focusing on the detail, Remain left the overall
premise unchallenged.</p>
<p>Having your opponents make a point for you, frees up your own
resources and own airtime for other points.</p>
<p>Not that it matters, as no one was listening. People voted for their
own reasons not because of anything Boris said.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>This is my design</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/design.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/design.png"/>
<p>This is a sequel to the <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a> about Britain’s relationship with
the EU. That ended with the conclusion that “However, we will leave in
the end, it is just a matter of time, and we will not be the only
ones.”</p>
<p>Little did I know that the people of Britain were already there ahead
of me. When the BBC’s coverage started under Britain’s leading
presenter, the great David Dimbleby. It seemed that the Remain side
was going to cruise home.</p>
<p>I thought, okay a noble fight, we made a point, but the forces of
multi-national capitalism were overwhelming. So I went to bed. After
all the two campaigns were not equal.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-lop-sided-campaign">
<h2>A lop sided campaign</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/scales.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/scales.png"/>
<p>The Remain side had all the forces of multi-national neo-liberal
capitalism, the banks, the European Commission as well as implicit
support from the supposedly independent Bank of England who popped up
occasionally with helpful statistics and reports.</p>
<p>A lot of people do their duty as citizens and vote, but are not really
interested in politics. They have enough on their plate with work and
family etc. These people were always likely to do what they were told
by the political leaders and also are biased towards the status quo.</p>
<p>The British government spent £9 million on posting a Remain booklet to
every house in the UK, a benefit that the Leave side did not get. We
also had the Prime Minister and the leadership of the other mainstream
parties like Labour, SNP and Greens supporting Remain.</p>
<p>The support of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was particularly
difficult as the traditional left wing position in Britain is to be
against the EU. The 1975 referendum, the No campaign was led by the
main Labour figures of the day Michael Foot, Tony Benn and Barbara
Castle.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/corbyn2.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/corbyn2.png"/>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn was a well known eurosceptic but as the leader of the
Labour party, whose MPs were mostly elected during the Blair years and
thus are mostly right wing, he was in a bit of a difficult
situation. So he did his duty as party leader and represented the
party line, appearing at events all across the country for Remain.</p>
<p>He did however refuse to make any out and out lies, and so when
cornered with a particularly forensic question, the truthful answer
was not always the most politically helpful answer for the Remain
side.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/corbyn.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/corbyn.png"/>
<p>The mainstream media were very pro-remain at first, especially the
publicly owned TV stations like the BBC and Channel 4, but the
newspapers started to drift away, even the Guardian started featuring
a few pro-leave articles in the last week or so of the campaign.</p>
<p>Moving from one newspaper to another is a matter of moving your hands
a few centimetres, so British newspapers do tend to reflect the views
of their readers to a certain extent, despite the owners tending to be
pro-Remain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-get-someone-out-of-bed">
<h2>How to get someone out of bed</h2>
<p>However, after a few hours of occasionally checking my phone in a
sleepy haze. Something was happening. Was I dreaming it?</p>
<p>Area after area went for Leave. London and its little spider legs of
wealth around London were going for Remain, as was Scotland, but the
rest of England and Wales mostly voted for Leave.</p>
<p>I decided to get back out of bed, go back downstairs and wait for the
Birmingham result.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="birmingham-is-for-leave">
<h2>Birmingham is for leave</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/selfridges.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/selfridges.jpg"/>
<p>Britain’s second largest city, Birmingham is not some twee ancient
town like the nearby Anglo-Saxon capital of Tamworth (see last
post). Birmingham is a child of the industrial revolution and the
Empire (also see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a>) with the major expansion of the city in
the 1800s and early 1900s. Birmingham is a beautiful city, as long as
you like Brutalist and Modern architecture.</p>
<p>Birmingham is somewhere between 45% and 50% “White British” (this
weird term is the designation the government uses), it isn’t the most
diverse city, which is Leicester and some the cities of the North but
it is the one I live in and know best.</p>
<p>The different races of Birmingham mostly get on very well, the city’s
signature dish is the Balti and the civic institutions put on events
that reflect the city’s diverse cultural backgrounds but are open to
all.</p>
<p>It is a Labour city. The right wing parties barely make a foothold,
there is no UKIP presence to speak of. There are 9 Labour MPs and just
one Tory MP in the outer suburb town of Sutton Coldfield, which
doesn’t even consider itself part of Birmingham.</p>
<p>Birmingham with its 700,000 registered voters in the main city area,
was expected to be a big remain landslide. When the result came it was
50.1% for Leave.</p>
<p>When you go through the posher areas of Birmingham, there were loads
of Remain posters on many of the large expensive houses, so it is not
mathematically possible or likely that all the votes to Leave were
from “White British”. So the Black and Asian voters of Birmingham were
split in the same way as the white voters, or at least enough to put
Leave over the top.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-question-that-remain-will-never-answer">
<h2>The question that Remain will never answer</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/silence.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/silence.jpg"/>
<p>I focused <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a> on the successful non-EU immigration that the UK
has had, and a good proportion of them seem to have gone for Leave, as
I thought they would. One of the questions I posed in my <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a> can
be summed up as follows:</p>
<p>Why should a Bulgarian be able to bring their family to the UK and
trade freely, but an immigrant from India cannot?</p>
<p>Despite being posed many times by Leave, this question was never
answered by the Remain side. Therefore, the Black and Asian vote split
and the Leave side benefited from a million or two more votes
nationally, which is of course a winning difference.</p>
<p>Why didn’t Remain field an answer? For four reasons I think.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="little-europeans">
<h2>Little Europeans</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/football.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/football.jpg"/>
<p>Firstly, is the ‘little Europeans’ issue I talked about in the last
post, the culture of the EU is about middle class White-European
people flying about between cities on expenses. Britain has a
Commonwealth history making us look at the world, a lot of Europe does
not.</p>
<p>Those Britons most in support of Europe tend to have this identity
also. The idea that people from outside the EU such as Africans or
Indians are equal to Europeans, and therefore the system should
reflect that, just doesn’t occur to them while hidden inside the walls
of fortress Europe. We might as well be talking Klingon for all the
good it does. There is just not the mental framework there to get it.</p>
<p>Remain also just assumed that all non-“White British” were theirs by
right and they did not have to work for it. The idea that Asian or
Black voters would have independent ideas and issues that should be
considered did not seem to be considered by Remain.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Remain side I think made a tactical decision not to
answer the question. They thought saying something like immigration is
good, we should open our borders to the Commonwealth too, but we are
not going to control EU migration at all to compensate, would push
more people to the Leave side.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="top-down-remain-bottom-up-leave">
<h2>Top down Remain, bottom up Leave</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/george.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/george.jpg"/>
<p>Thirdly, because the Remain side inherited the infrastructure of the
Labour and Tory parties, they followed a lot of top-down practices
that made sense in a constituency first-past the post based system. So
they sought to get a simple majority in each area, rather than
focusing on total number of votes. They assumed that most Midland and
Northern cities as well as Wales, would overall go for Remain so
didn’t put any real effort into those areas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Leave campaign, short of financial resources, had to run
a grass roots, bottom up campaign. They found out the questions
putting people off Leave and had to come up with some kind of answer
to the questions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several Unions like the RMT, ASLEF and BFAWU; left-wing
anti-establishment figures like George Galloway and Julian Assange, as
well as the socialist worker and many others, were rallying the
non-mainstream media, blogs, and social networks to the Leave side.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-brainwash-yourself">
<h2>How to brainwash yourself</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/godzilla.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/godzilla.png"/>
<p>The forth reason is connected to the last part, and the most important
issue and this is a wider reason to why Remain lost. They believed
their own propaganda, they brainwashed themselves. Believing that
there were no valid reasons want Leave apart from to control
immigration, they didn’t field any answers to the questions being
raised.</p>
<p>Remain just focused on two messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Project Fear - leaving the EU would be the end of the world.  The
Chancellor George Osborne, previously featured on this blog, the one
that likes to take money from disabled people and give it as tax
breaks to billionaires; he made a much lampooned threat of an
emergency budget requiring massive tax rises and spending
cuts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was the even more preposterous argument that the UK
leaving the EU would be the end of peace in Europe. I don’t even
know what this means. Are Germany going to restart the blitz and
rain down bombs on our heads? Is the UK going to gather an army of
longbowmen and retake Agincourt? What a lot of utter nonsense.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Project Sneer - anyone who is for leaving the EU is a racist Nazi
who wants to round up immigrants and throw them into the
sea. Equally stupid. We will talk about this again shortly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While immigration was an issue of course, the Leave campaign also
focused on many issues that were not immigration including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TTIP which does actually include healthcare and results in the break
up of the NHS and private health insurance from American companies</li>
<li>The issue of little-Europeanism/racism we just talked about</li>
<li>The fortress Europe that makes it difficult to trade with non-EU
countries which are the growing part of the world.</li>
<li>The lack of democracy in the European institutions. Only the
Commission can introduce laws and repeal laws. The elected European
Parliament can just discuss them. It has about us much power as the
fantastic UK youth parliament where school children go into the
house of parliament and discuss laws.</li>
<li>The focus on complex regulations instead of Common Law</li>
<li>The economic and social punishment given by the EU to Greece (see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a>)</li>
<li>Unemployment levels on the Continent.</li>
<li>You could go on and on.</li>
<li>The way the EU’s Thatcherite policies help distort the allocation of
resources towards London and the Financial sector and away from
manufacturing and wider England.</li>
</ul>
<p>Birmingham is a traditional capital of manufacturing, and still has
the productive capacity hanging on for when Britain starts depending
on making and selling things, rather than relying on financial scams
for its national income.</p>
<p>I wonder if this had a lot to do with why Wales voted Leave. The EU is
keen to spend our money on museums, University buildings, and so
on. But anything that might give areas like Birmingham or Wales a
competitive manufacturing advantage is not allowed. Just look what
happened recently to the Port Talbot Steelworks, EU regulations
stopped the government from acting to save this vital national
resource from Chinese steel dumping; steel is the foundation of
national defence after all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="echo-chamber">
<h2>Echo chamber</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/brainwash.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/brainwash.jpg"/>
<p>The Remain side acted like an echo chamber. Its core message of
sneering at everyone that is not an EU-supporting cultural liberal
from Cambridge or London cost it dearly. The remain side followed its
own supporters on social networks, it did not engage with the
non-mainstream media of right or left, it did not go out and listen to
people’s reasons for Leave and provide an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Therefore they lost.</p>
<p>Ignoring the merits of the argument for a moment, the Remain campaign,
despite every possible advantage, managed to misstep at every possible
moment. From Osborne’s terror budget to trying to make political
capital out of the tragic death of an MP, there was not much
self-awareness.</p>
<p>Piling on the war monger Tony Blair and everyone responsible for the
2008 crash did not improve their credibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consumers-in-denial">
<h2>Consumers in denial</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/consumer.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/consumer.png"/>
<p>When the result came, many tears were cried and much gnashing of teeth
by Remain supporters.</p>
<p>Several days on, the vestiges of Remain support are still in full on
denial. By not listening to voters in England and Wales outside London
and its small tentacles into the home counties and the University
cities of Oxford and Cambridge, they were totally dumbfounded that the
country voted against them.</p>
<p>Democracy is not about ordering a policy like a pair of shoes from
Amazon. You have to listen, you have to engage, you have to convince
people that are not like yourself, you have to build a coalition of
support.</p>
<p>Mocking people and blocking people on Twitter does not constitute
productive debate. Calling people racists or stupid does not move them
into your camp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-referendum">
<h2>Second Referendum</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/fleshwound.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/fleshwound.jpg"/>
<p>The biggest joke of all is the idea of a second referendum. The people
who did not and will not listen want to have another vote and
keep having them until they get the result they want.</p>
<p>The Leave side had to wait over 40 years for a referendum. The Remain
side want one tomorrow.</p>
<p>This will not work.</p>
<p>Firstly, this referendum was extremely expensive in staff costs, venue
costs and lost productivity as schools and other public buildings are
closed. All elections are expensive and take a long time to
organise. Being based on the popular vote, it is a bit more
complicated than the normal constituency system that we are geared up
for. Normally there are lots of safe seats that never change and have
massive winning margins that don’t really require much precision or
huge amounts of staff.</p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of advantages the remain side had will no longer exist:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>David Cameron quit and there will be no pro-remain Prime Minister
again leading the charge and offering potential promotions and
knighthoods etc for those on his/her side.</li>
<li>Everyone is knackered. Labour and the Unions spent all their
campaign budgets and desperately need to save cash, energy and
volunteers for the next set of local elections and a possible snap
general election. Campaigners from other institutions like NGOs and
companies need to go back to their real jobs.</li>
<li>Project Fear is over, the British public already voted out and are
no longer scared. Those who felt they had to ignore their heart will
not need to do so again.</li>
<li>Project Sneer is ineffective because anyone previously scared of
talking about being out for fear of being seen as a racist or UKIP
supporter, has nothing to fear as they are with the majority 52% and
rising.</li>
<li>Any new referendum will be from the outside. The status quo will be
for remain out. The only people still for out will be a coalition of
cultural liberals and dodgy bankers.</li>
<li>The EU has had enough of us. When they say Britain is toxic and
causes contagion, it means that other countries want the special
deals we have had like vetos, partial rebate, no Schengen, no
Euro. They think the sooner we nasty Island hobbits are at arms
length, the longer they can keep the EU from collapsing. They are
deluded of course, but that is a discussion for another post.</li>
<li>Events - lots of nasty crap is coming down the pipe for Europe, it
will look more unattractive as time goes on. Also other countries
may leave.</li>
<li>Demographics - Non-EU migrants have the highest birth rate. So as
the years go on, ignoring the world outside and the issues we talked
about above becomes more untenable.</li>
<li>No More Patronage - the UK will now need its own systems for funding
Universities, research, regional development, farming, etc. People
will adapt to them and will no longer feel tied to Europe by an
umbilical cord of funding.</li>
<li>Progressive policies - the UK will increasingly find solutions that
are not legal or tenable in the EU. Rail nationalisation, student
scholarships, NHS re-nationalisation and so on. Once setup, they
will act us as a permanent lock keeping us out of the EU.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we run the referendum again, it will just be embarrassing. Leave
will get 70%, or maybe much more, if we are already out then 80% or
90% I can totally believe. We need to save our fellow citizens from
self-harm and mental anguish and just say no to that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>This is my design</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/chickens.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/chickens.jpg"/>
<p>I don’t deny that Leave vote had white bigots, but it also had
socialists (like me) and a good amount of BME population outside
London.</p>
<p>In any case, the past is the past, we are on the way out.</p>
<p>The far right bigots will get a shock when it finds that the
independent UK actually increases immigration as it booms free of the
EU. This time our immigration policy can be race and nationality
blind, allowing the whole world to come here on an equal basis,
especially the Commonwealth countries who sent 4 million of their
citizens to fight and die alongside us in World War II and whom we
have treated terribly since.</p>
<p>I love Europe, I just don’t like the centralised Roman Empire style
state (see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a>). I want the UK to engage with the EU countries
on a bi-lateral basis, and on the level of people and companies, as a
real union of peoples, not a neoliberal cage where everything has to
go via a centralised Brussels bureaucracy. I also want the UK to lift
its eyes and interact with the wider world.</p>
<p>This is our chance to do things differently. As we replace EU run
areas with local ones, we can upgrade them with modern values and
technology.</p>
<p>Our farming and fishing policies can have the greatest environmental
standards in the world. We can finally ban battery chickens and give
incentives for Organic food. We can stop the nonsense of paying people
not to produce food and instead pay them to upgrade their animal
welfare and environmental standards.</p>
<p>Our research policy can focus on devolving funding to the Universities
themselves, trusting them to invest in long term research
projects. Get the professors back in the lab and the lecturers back in
the classroom, rather than making them spend all their time bidding
for short-term grants.</p>
<p>We can return to making and not depend on the financial scams for our
national income.</p>
<p>We can increase the minimum wage to a real living wage and thus
encourage the use of automation, machines and robots (see end of last
post).</p>
<p>The excuse in the past was that if we could not give our young people
full scholarships to University, because it would be untenable to
offer them to the whole EU. Now there is no excuse, we should give all
young people a scholarship so they begin their careers with skills and
knowledge not debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boris-britain">
<h2>Boris’ Britain</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/debate.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/debate.jpg"/>
<p>Birmingham’s own Giesla Stewart was the voice of reason in this
campaign and the official leader of the Leave campaign. Giesla had a
good campaign and did very well. However, the mainstream media only
wanted to show Boris.</p>
<p>I must admit Boris also had a good campaign. He didn’t make any gaffs
and he looked like a leader, he stood up and took the incoming flack
from Remain and effortlessly outflanked his Tory opponents by pivoting
to the left when required. He seemed very comfortable and
statesmanlike sharing cross-party platforms with Labour Leave figures
such as Gielsa, Kate Hoey and others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile David Cameron refused to debate his opponents and looked like he
was afraid. The remain side didn’t manage to combine the two campaigns
very well.</p>
<p>Boris is going to win the Tory leadership, it will probably seem like
a coronation, then he will try to bounce a snap election and get a
strong mandate and he may win.</p>
<p>The left need to stop moping over the UK’s European exit and unite or
Boris will get a landslide.</p>
<p>We can make the progressive case and win the next election. We can
stop Boris’s Britain and make Britain a progressive country once
again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Rome Vs The Matrix</h1>
<p>I would like to tell you a story. This is a story of how we the
British people, and we the planet, got here and more importantly where
we should go next. It is still a work in progress. If you are of a
like mind, please help me to improve it. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="section" id="dogglerland">
<h2>Dogglerland</h2>
<p>After the last Ice Age, Britain was certainly a part of Europe, the
Thames and the Rhine met and Woolly Mammoths and later people walked
across to Britain.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/doggerland.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/doggerland.png"/>
<p>However, God decided out of wisdom or for a joke, that Britain should
be an island and smashed the land bridge with the Hammer of the
Waters <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, throughout history, idealists have been trying to glue
Britain back onto Europe, without much success.</p>
<p>However, this unavoidable geological and geographical fact remained
and still remains, and it gave us a very different history to the
continental peoples of Europe. I think it also gives us a very
different future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-dos">
<h2>Rome DOS</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/rome.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/rome.png"/>
<p>Julius Caesar’s made expeditions to ancient Britain in 55 and 54 BC,
it was the beginning of a pattern. The Romans could enter Britain and
conqueror territory, but they could not hold it.</p>
<p>Whether is was Boudica, the Iceni queen who burned down the Roman
settlements at modern day Colchester, London and St Albans; the
inability to make progress in the North, modern day Scotland, Wales or
Cornwall; or countless other defeats; the Romans never achieved a
stable position in Britain.</p>
<p>Roman Britain existed within its urban colonies but despite a massive
investment in infrastructure, such as the famous road network,
conquering Britain was never a serious enough priority to divert the
required military forces to subdue the people of Britain once and for
all.</p>
<p>Roman officials and retired veteran troops settled in Britain had a
tendency to go native and side with the locals over Rome, not least
for survival, intermarriage with local tribes brought more security
than the Roman state, which was more annoyed than responsive when the
frequent requests for rescue came. After a few hundred years of
half-hearted efforts of colonisation, Rome stopped answering
altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="charlemagne-and-rome-3-11">
<h2>Charlemagne and Rome 3.11</h2>
<p>However, in Europe, despite the collapse of the Romans, the Byzantine
and Frankish Kings were trying to recreate and hold the Roman Empire,
Charlemagne being the most famous, he conquered a good part most of Western
Europe.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/charlemagne.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/charlemagne.png"/>
<p>For those on the continent, they have a 2000 year process of
recreating the Roman Empire. However, we were barely in it to start
with, and haven’t joined since.</p>
<p>While Charlemagne was winning battle after battle, back in Britain,
something very different was happening. As the Romans had faded out,
the Saxons faded in, it wasn’t very long before the Mercian Supremacy
united England under the Saxon Kings and their capital of Tamworth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="normandy">
<h2>Normandy</h2>
<p>William I, also known as William the Conqueror, the first king on the
back of the space-limited 1 foot rulers traditionally given to British
schoolchildren, was cousin and in his own mind at least, heir, to the
previous king Edward the Confessor.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/arrow.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/arrow.png"/>
<p>With the arrow through King Harold’s eye, the Anglo-Saxon era of
Britain had ended and the Norman age had begun.</p>
<p>Despite Northern France being their ancestral homeland, the Norman
Kings and their Tudor descendents failed to hold together England and
France, losing Normandy and the rest of their homelands to the Franks.</p>
<p>They had more luck in the westerly direction, conquering the various
little kingdoms in Ireland by war and marriage, while Henry VIII
managed to create a peaceful union with Wales. However, all attempts
to secure a legal heir either by legitimising his son Henry FitzRoy or
divorcing required permission from the Pope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="english-independence-from-rome-95">
<h2>English Independence from Rome 95</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/charles5.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/charles5.png"/>
<p>The Pope had bigger problems than pleasing the English (and Welsh and
Irish) King, Emperor Charles V was once again building a united
Europe. Grumbles about papal rule and (in practice) subservience to
the Holy Roman Empire had been bubbling for many years in parliament
over a range of issues, but the international marriages of the King
had always meant the monarchy was a limit to how far parliament could
act.</p>
<p>Now with the King on the side, the Acts of Supremacy was could be
passed, meaning the King and the secular parliament would now rule the
Kingdom, the role of the Church was confined to moral matters alone,
and England was no longer seen as a minor partner or dependency of the
Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>This also enabled union with protestant Scotland, and James VI of
Scotland became James I of England. Despite the movie of the evil
English killing poor blue painted Mel Gibson and the moans of today’s
Scottish nationalists, it was actually the Scottish that (peacefully)
conquered England.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom was now a confident and powerful country. Freedom
of thought led to the industrial revolution, which we will come back
to later.</p>
<p>Catholic Europe and its supporters did not take this lying down,
England was still a valuable prize to add to a European empire. The
Spanish Armada was the most famous failed attempt at an invasion, and
the Gunpowder Plot tried to blow up parliament with James I inside.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-last-attempts-at-uk-european-integration">
<h2>Two last attempts at UK-European integration</h2>
<p>A more consensual(ish) attempt of European integration was when
parliament invited William of Orange to become the King William III
and so he did. For a brief period it seemed like the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands would become one country. However, William was
childless when he fell of his horse and died, and each Kingdom had
different rules over the succession, and that was that.</p>
<p>Next in line was his sister in law, Queen Anne, the last truly English
monarch. Under her rule there was a major humanitarian crisis on the
continent. King Louis of France decided to commit genocide against the
Huguenot people and wipe them out in a series of massacres, half a
million left France in a giant exodus.</p>
<p>Queen Anne opened Britain’s borders and 50,000 Huguenots moved
here. Queen Anne’s new immigration policy was simple, anyone who
turned up and pledged allegiance to the Queen was immediately part of
the British population.</p>
<p>The open border policy lasted for hundreds of years. The barriers were
only put up fully in the late 20th Century, when we were already in
the European Union.</p>
<p>Anyway, like William, Queen Anne also died childless. What happened
next is quite interesting. Parliament chose the next King from a list
of potentially suitable Princes and Princesses. They settled on George
of Hanover, the 58th in line to the throne and non-English speaking.</p>
<p>We were now in a union with a mid-level German principality, but like
all our other European alliances, it broke down and it eventually the
Kingdom of Hanover became part of the German Empire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="britain-in-the-world">
<h2>Britain in the World</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/britishempire.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/britishempire.png"/>
<p>By now Britain had lost interest in European affairs, we were part of
a global Empire on which the sun never set. Lots of terrible evil
things happened, which everyone talks about but also some good things,
which people don’t talk so much about.</p>
<p>On a purely economic level, the Empire was a giant mistake. What
started as an attempt to get a set of sustainable safe ports ended up
covering a quarter of the world. It was the industrial firms of the UK
that had to subsidise the infrastructure of Empire building, and as
other countries got their industrial revolution, the sums no longer
added up.</p>
<p>If we had just defended these ports, and given countries their
independence quicker, would they have been more free? Or would an even
less benign European power have swooped in and taken them?</p>
<p>Anyway, the Empire and all its good and evil and idiosyncrasies
happened. The Commonwealth is there? Why do we ignore it?</p>
<p>We discovered medical treatments and we started Canada, Australia and
New Zealand. From a small patchwork of feudal kingdoms, we united
India - against us of course - but now it is one of the greatest
countries in the world.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/tea.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/tea.png"/>
<p>Obviously we cannot take credit for India’s hard work but we did leave
them the world’s largest railway, Westminster-style parliamentary
democracy and the English language which they are using brilliantly to
trade internationally, they are the winners.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth is the growing part of the world, the 21st century is
their century. Why shut them out just to stay in a club of losers?
Lets get stuck in and help the Commonwealth countries develop. The old
masters can become the servants, lets not be too proud and have some
humility.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/textile.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/textile.jpg"/>
<p>The Empire was not a one way street, we learned a lot from the
Commonwealth peoples. We got tea, carpets, colourful patterns and new
artistic and musical forms, new philosophies and our national
obsession with curry.</p>
<p>By being exposed to the world, the values of the British people
started to change. We realised that people were not so different. We
went into the world as gold-hungry pirates but started coming back
with new values.</p>
<p>The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade started
from those who had gone out into the Empire and not found blood
thirsty savages, but instead found friends and lovers, decent human
beings. To make sense of it they went back to the New Testament notion
that God made all men are equal and all men are our brothers.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/antislavery.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/antislavery.jpg"/>
<p>This came to a head when the great Christian leader and
parliamentarian William Wilberforce led the social and parliamentary
campaign to abolish slavery.</p>
<p>Since everyone is our brother and sister, all men should be made free
of slavery, oppression and poverty and it is our responsibility as
human beings to make it happen, to bring freedom to the world. Not
wait for the oppressed to take back their own freedom, it is
everyone’s job, especially the advanced country that is Britain.</p>
<p>This sounds simple and obvious now, but in the late 1700s this was a
radical idea, the first time it had been exposed.</p>
<p>It is an unavoidable historical fact that this was a British (and
Dutch) movement. During this period, Germany and much of continental
culture was going in a totally opposite direction, building the
foundations of fascism.</p>
<p>I don’t say this for nationalistic reasons but to point out that human
rights did not start because of the EU. We were already starting to
take a first step down this path three hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why God brought the hammer down on Doggerland, to give
us a more global perspective. Once you have built a boat to sail to
Europe, you can use that same boat to explore the world, then you find
that everyone is a human being.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-last-patriot">
<h2>The last patriot</h2>
<p>American Independence is today framed as a fight for freedom, Mel
Gibson being killed (again) by the evil English, and to a large extent
that is accurate. However, what they don’t like to mention is that one
of the factors driving American Independence was a fear among American
slave owners that Britain was going wobbly on slavery. They were
right, we were.</p>
<p>What is also true is that the newly independent America went backwards
on the rights of Black people and native Americans for the first 50 to
75 years.</p>
<p>One thing that the British navy based in its territory in Canada liked
to do was to go down to plantations in the American south and rescue
slaves, many thousands of whom settled in Canada and in the UK.</p>
<p>We should have done more. We should have freed every last slave, even
if it meant abolishing the US government and killing Mel Gibson a
third time. All people are equal. Those who are oppressed we must
help.</p>
<p>All Britons got free healthcare in 1948. If you are black in America
today you are three times as likely to not have decent health
insurance than a white person. America was 75 years behind us in 1800
and it is still 75 years behind now.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is not the time to import the US health care system
via TTIP. Sadly, the EU has it on the cards and we cannot escape it
while being a member. If you or your family has what the Americans
call ‘pre-existing condition’, then expect significantly worse and
more expensive healthcare than we have now.</p>
<p>I actually love Americans and American culture. I hate their war
mongering governments. I love San Francisco and hate Washington DC.</p>
<p>We should have free trade with America, but at the moment the American
government is only offering take or it leave it terms. I think we
should leave it.</p>
<p>I also dislike the idea that to criticise the American government is a
problem. I don’t want to live there. I don’t want UK to become America
either. I don’t want their ideas about private healthcare, GMO foods,
Fracking or a culture based on the ownership of guns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-xp-world-war-i">
<h2>Rome XP: World War I</h2>
<p>When Napoleon tried to create a united Gallic Europe, we were going to
lose our essential pit stop of Malta and possibly lose access through
Mediterranean, as well as our allies being attacked.</p>
<p>So we popped over the channel and put Napoleon is his box but lost
interest afterwards. As we saw above, we long ago lost interest in
holding possessions on the mainland of the continent.</p>
<p>So after Napoleon, it was still France that was seen as the potential
trouble maker. In general, in the 19th Century, Relations between
Britain and Germany were very good. Back then Britain still believed
it was a Germanic people, the Anglo-Saxons, and we had our recently
imported German kings. All that was deliberately and rapidly washed
away in the build up to World War II so it is quite hard to comprehend
now.</p>
<p>Our main priority was always free trade routes, as long as we could go
past Europe through the Mediterranean, we didn’t want to interfere in
the continent and they didn’t want to interfere in our empire, we just
wanted happy neighbours.</p>
<p>However, while we were sailing off around the world, causing chaos,
building railways, drinking gin and rethinking what it was to be
British and human. The Europeans were still trying to make the Roman
empire. They couldn’t agree if it would be a French empire or a German
one but now they had better guns which spiralled into World War I.</p>
<p>The Austrian Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by Serbia. The UK tried
to make France and Germany just get along. They didn’t
listen. Politicians and generals on both sides decided this was the
perfect excuse to defeat the other and become the new Roman empire.</p>
<p>When German and France started fighting, we still tried to calm it all
down. The problem was that Britain a had given security guarantee to
Belgium in 1839, not sure the UK even remembered but the
Belgians did. So when on the 4th August 1914, Germany troops marched
through Belgium to attack France, the guarantee was triggered.</p>
<p>The British public was totally confused, weren’t we a Germanic people?
Isn’t France the country of Napoleon? Aren’t France the bad guys? Why
do we even care about Belgium anyway?</p>
<p>In the confusion of complex European politics, to the government
honouring the deal with Belgium seemed like a precise and specific
aim that didn’t require a master plan for the continent.</p>
<p>The government decided it could clear out Belgium and be back home in
a week, back home in time for Christmas, back home in time for New
year...</p>
<p>We went into World War I as a naval power with little recent
experience of fighting warfare on land against an equally advanced
enemy. Sea battles against an inferior foe last a day or two, maybe a
couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The War dragged on for 4 long years and we lost a million of our best
and brightest people for no gain whatsoever. Progressive social
changes started going backwards. Long promised reforms and freedoms
promised to Ireland were delayed by the war and we lost them. We
bankrupted ourselves and started to lose the whole Empire. We even
killed Mel Gibson again at the incompetently run campaign at
Gallipoli.</p>
<p>France continued Empire building in the Treaty of Versailles, trying
to guarantee a permanent superiority over Germany. The UK delegation,
“the Heavenly Twins”, bankers who were brought in as “worthy finance
experts”, despite advice from Keynes in the Treasury to prioritise
making sure post-war Germany was viable and don’t worry about making
money, decided it wanted a huge pile of money out of Germany too.</p>
<p>If only people today would learn to ignore bankers and ‘worthy’
figures of high finance and listen to Keynes, maybe we would not have
the financial crash, the Greece crisis, or in fact World War II.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-7-world-war-ii">
<h2>Rome 7 - World War II</h2>
<p>Between the wars, America had started to make aggressive moves against
Britain and its empire, so wasn’t even looking at Nazi Germany. If any
threat loomed it was from those evil red communists in Russia.</p>
<p>Britain likewise hardly noticed, struggling to deal with colonial
demands for independence.</p>
<p>When the first moves in Hitler’s game started, many assumed it was
just a corrective to the Treaty of Versailles. Maybe partly it was,
but Hitler had got the taste of momentum and was never going to stop.</p>
<p>Hitler, like those before, wanted his own version of a united
Europe. Mussolini even used the Roman symbolism directly.</p>
<p>Hitler called Charles V’s Holy Roman Empire (see above) the First
Reich. Bismarck’s Prussian Empire was the Second Reich, and Hitler’s
own rise to power was the Third Reich, the third German attempt at a
pan-European state (ignoring all the other attempts).</p>
<p>This time, it really could not be ignored. Hitler’s grand vision of a
united Europe left no room for anyone else, whether internal
minorities such as the Jews, or external powers such as Britain.</p>
<p>Germany was the master race, a white Europe united under one
government with white troops wearing even whiter shirts.</p>
<p>Britain stood alone against Hitler!</p>
<p>Erm well no. Not really at all.</p>
<p>Forces that the UK fielded were a multi-racial bunch. As well as my
Granddad and other British residents and thousands of Australians and
Canadians, we had 2.5 million Indian volunteers, we had a Burma
Division, a Fiji Infantry Regiment, the Royal Malay Regiment, the Arab
Legion and Africa sent six whole divisions of black African
volunteers. It goes on and on.</p>
<p>In the following image, comrades look on as a West African soldier is
treated by doctors. Many thousand Africans and a million Indians died
for our freedom.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/west_african_casualties.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/west_african_casualties.jpg"/>
<p>Despite all the injustices, problems, disagreements, desires for
independence, etc, when we needed them, the Commonwealth was there for
us. We wouldn’t even have a UK if it was not for them.</p>
<p>Oh yeah and even the Americans came. Eventually. Thanks. We love
you. God bless America.</p>
<p>The multi-racial international British Commonwealth and America beat
the white European master race and their all-white allies because all
people are equal, all are valid, and all have something to
contribute. You don’t have to live in Europe to be valuable.</p>
<p>In 1972, the UK was still not yet in the EU so our borders will still
largely open to the world, as they had been since the days of Queen
Anne.</p>
<p>Independent Uganda decided to expel all 50,000 of its citizens from
Indian origin. 27,200 of them settled in the UK.  It wasn’t all
easy, there was a lot of racism from the right and support from the
real socialists, but they thrived here and like the Huguenots,
they became an essential part of the UK population.</p>
<p>The Socialist worker at the time tried to explain to the British
people they had nothing to fear:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/swcover.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/swcover.jpg"/>
<p>It is the racist financial elite and the mainstream media that tries
to people of Britain against our cousins in the Commonwealth, and they
still do it today.</p>
<p>The Guardian is nice, it has a handy app that means I can read it on
the toilet, but it is not a left-wing paper, it is a right-wing
mainstream media paper like the rest. This is the age of the Internet,
diversify your information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-10-the-european-union">
<h2>Rome 10 - The European Union</h2>
<p>A factor in the wars between France and Germany is that the bordering
areas are rich in natural resources. Sharing them helps to prevent
arguments which makes peace. In this context the post-war European
Coal and Steel Community makes a lot of sense. But Britain has never
dug the Ruhr. It doesn’t mean anything to us.</p>
<p>Brussels is the mid-point between France and Germany, good location
for them but it doesn’t mean anything to UK except the site of some
stupid unnecessary wars between France and Germany where our
grandparents and great-grandparents suffered. We did not need to join
the EU to stop us conquering France or Belgium. UK has been finished
with that since 1534.</p>
<p>So the fact the symbolism of the EU means more to France and Germany
and means little to UK, doesn’t come us much surprise.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/greece.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/greece.jpg"/>
<p>The EU used to be like a benign attempt at a Roman Empire, but it has
become increasingly hostile to its own people, see what happened in
Greece, and it is increasingly out of step with British values, go
read about TTIP. Read about the Viking Line labour dispute. The EU has
long ceased to be a progressive force, if it ever was.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/greece2.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/greece2.jpg"/>
<p>It has a centralised, proprietary setup where the only people that can
influence decisions are yesterday’s multinational corporations. It
then puts a phoney parliament on top as a democratic fig leaf. The
European ‘Parliament’ has two fancy state of the art buildings that it
shuttles between. What it cannot do is make any new laws or repeal any
old ones. Only the unelected Commission can write new laws, as for
repealing laws, there is not a system for that. What a joke!</p>
<p id="party1999">In 1999, I was an undergraduate with a giant EU flag on the wall of my
dorm. I read all the propaganda, went on all the trips. I wrote essays
saying while the EU was currently undemocratic, bad for the
environment, and bad for the developing world, it would be fixed
soon. It wasn’t. All we had to do was co-operate and wait and it will
reform. It didn’t.</p>
<p>I even waited in the Snow in 2002 outside the Bank of Finland to get
some of the first Euros. What a mistake the Euro was, it has
bankrupted Greece and left many of the young people of Europe without
a hope of jobs.</p>
<p>Those who funded the Remain campaign are the same people that caused
the financial crisis of 2008: Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and
J.P. Morgan. They are not our friends or allies.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/disabled.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/disabled.jpg"/>
<p>Much is made to dismiss left arguments for exit because Nigel Farage
wants exit. Whatever one may think of him, he has never held power to
hurt anyone and never will have power. Meanwhile, Remain’s George
Osborne has had power and used it to take money from disabled people
and give it to the same billionaires that are backing remain.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/tonyblair.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/tonyblair.jpg"/>
<p>Then we come to Remain’s Tony Blair.</p>
<p>Britain in recent history didn’t start wars or kill people, yay! We
had finally learned from our past mistakes. That is until the lying
warmonger Tony Blair came along.</p>
<p>My own faith in Britain took a massive nosedive then and probably
hasn’t recovered, maybe it never will, it is now the
cyber-internationale or nothing.</p>
<p>Blair is responsible for choosing to start a war which has killed up
to a million people. I will not stand with him and I will probably not
agree with him on anything. When you take the same side as Blair, I
see you as a right-wing Blairite, I do have to admit that. You have to
to, you are one. It is better to be honest that you are right of me.</p>
<p>I am not a European. I am British and I am a human and like
Wilberforce, I believe being a human is the more important fact.</p>
<p>I don’t see the need for any layers in between.</p>
<p>I believe that a Kenyan or an Indian or an Australian or a native
American is as equal to a Bulgarian or a Hungarian.</p>
<p>The EU means that someone 1000 miles east of me has equal rights to me
in the UK but someone 1000 miles south of me has none. I find that
completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>The real truth is that European countries are all white, that is the
only unifying factor. That is a racist way to order the world.</p>
<p>There is a lot of middle-class European nationalism, as if it is an
acceptable form of nationalism, and an acceptable form of racism. It
is not. To me it just seems like the last 2000 years of re-making the
Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Moving on from being a little Englander is not be a little European,
it is to be a citizen of the whole world.</p>
<p>There is a lot of middle-class sneering at the out campaign, that it
is full of racists and not the right kind of educated people in the
Remain campaign. A racist with a degree is still a racist. The remain
campaign is equally racist. Just one step zoomed out. They are still
putting up trade and immigration barriers to everyone who is not in
the arbitrary group of 28 majority-white countries that is the EU.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a degree, if you are a normal working person sick of
the sneering; I have three degrees, you can imagine one of them is
yours. They don’t mean anything here. Your voice is equal to the most
loftiest expert. Stick to your beliefs. RMT, ASLEF, BFAWU and other
Trade Unions supporting Leave know as much, if not more, than the
forces of neo-liberal capitalism.</p>
<p>The fact is the Europeans don’t have the Commonwealth history and
the relatively happy race relations we have in the UK. We have a
different history. That is fine. Let them get on with their Rome
building.</p>
<p>Britain can leave and rejoin our Commonwealth and the rest of the
world. If Rome 10 still wants to trade with us afterwards, fine, if
not fine. We have a massive balance of trade deficit with them anyway
so not having a trade deal would both hurt and help us.  For Rome 10,
not having a trade deal would only hurt them.</p>
<p>Why do you think we have a massive balance of trade deficit with the
EU in the first place?</p>
<p>If you remember, the Commonwealth is a group of ccountries whose
citizens had stood up and died for us in the war. Before we joined the
EU, we put had trade barriers with to the Commonwealth. We had a
complementary relationship, we sold them cars and machines and they
sold us food, carpets, clothes, tea and so on.</p>
<p>We used to eat cheap food grown without chemicals in the hot sun in
Australia, Africa and India. Now we eat expensive pesticide covered
fruit grown in heated greenhouses in the low countries. Next up with
the EU’s TTIP, we are going to eat American GMO and hormone treated
foods, God help us.</p>
<p>We turned on back on the Commonwealth to join a group of similar
economies in Europe. We tried to out German the Germans and
failed. Why would Germany need to buy our cars or advanced technology?
It can make cars itself and often better.</p>
<p>Putting up trade barriers to complimentary countries was a mistake. We
cannot all do the same thing. We cannot all do everything. We all live
on one planet and we all do best if we all work together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-information-age">
<h2>The Information Age</h2>
<p>After the Scottish and English reformations, we had growing freedom of
thought and expression, without which the technological and scientific
discoveries of the industrial revolution would not be possible.</p>
<p>The machine, from a simple lever to a super computer, magnifies human
activity. We have combine harvesters, medical equipment,
airplanes. This magnification in productivity has the potential to
bring food, health and wealth to every member of our species.</p>
<p>We also need to think about our planet and the other species we share
it with.</p>
<p>In this informational age, the EU has nothing to offer, it just wants
to bring in software patents so yesterday’s innovators can have
monopoly rent. Where is the European Google? Why is all the innovation
happening in America, India and China?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-neo-liberal-sweatshop-agenda">
<h2>The Neo-liberal sweatshop agenda</h2>
<p>So far the fruits of the industrial revolution, and now the
information revolution, have not been shared very fairly.</p>
<p>There is this horrible propaganda: “immigrants do the jobs British
people are not willing to do”.</p>
<p>Existing residents used to be happy picking vegetables, doing factory
work, doing care work. These used to be fairly paid secure
jobs. People doing these unskilled jobs could afford to buy a house
and all the essentials of life.</p>
<p>They did not suddenly become work shy. What happened is that secure
contracts were replaced with insecure agency work with serf-like
conditions. Local people cannot afford to take them and still raise
their families. If your family is abroad where the living costs are
lower, then maybe you can make it work but you are still being
exploited.</p>
<p>If it is not good enough for a British person, it is not good enough
for an Eastern European. Building our economy on the exploitation of
Eastern Europe is no more ethical than building an Empire on the backs
of Africans and Indians.</p>
<p>This was a choice, none of this happen by accident, it was designed to
happen, and the forces of neo-liberalism are becoming very rich
because of it.</p>
<p>The stupid thing is that companies with well paid workers in safe
conditions using machines, lose contracts to cowboys hiring mass
numbers of workers in unstable situations, both here and abroad. It is
a technological de-evolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enter-the-matrix">
<h2>Enter the Matrix</h2>
<p>Progress goes backwards but it also goes forwards again. Even if
temporarily a sweatshop is cheaper than a machine, we can make more
productive machines. If an industrial process makes pollution, we can
make cleaner machines.</p>
<p>The future of our species is not about providing low paid insecure
work, it is about using technology to automate and make work
productive enough that we can give everyone decent and fair
conditions.</p>
<p>We need more automation, more machines, and yes more developers
writing software to run it all.</p>
<p>In the Terminator movies, the real hero is not the gun toting Sarah
Conner, it is Skynet. In the Matrix, the hero is Agent Smith.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/everyone.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/everyone.jpg"/>
<p>I don’t want to make Rome, I want to make the Matrix. I want us to
work with the whole world and help give them all food, clean water,
healthcare, computers and freedom.</p>
<p>The real conservative forces of high finance, the same guys that run
the mainstream media and control the EU, of course want to convince
you to remain. For me, it is part of the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>Maybe we don’t leave this EU this week, I hope we do but the polls are
not looking good, people are accepting the Goldman Sach’s funded
messages. David Cameron won two referendums already using his
anti-progressive project fear. I can believe he can win this one too.</p>
<p>However, we will leave in the end, it is just a matter of time, and we
will not be the only ones. Across Europe, people are waking up. We
don’t need a centralised proprietary government in Brussels to work
together across borders. People are coming up with new models for open
source government and distributed co-operation. We have just got to
pull the arrow of neo-liberalism out of our eyes.</p>
<p>A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of technological
utopianism. The idea of socialism has existed for a long time, but
only now are we finally getting to a technological level where it can
become possible.</p>
<p>Lets make it happen.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Case of the Pirate Gamepad</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/pirategamepad.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/pirategamepad.jpg"/>
<p>I made some software (which will be explained in a future post) and
used my trusty Argos third-party PS3 style gamepad to control it.</p>
<p>On the way to open sourcing it, I thought I had better try it with a
an official Sony PS3 gamepad, and I could always do with another
gamepad for when playing computer with the sprog.</p>
<p>We play a lot of open source games like SuperTuxKart and Frogatto
which are two of our favourites. To be honest we play almost every
game made available through Debian’s Apt.</p>
<p>So not really thinking too heavily about it, I popped onto a leading
auction website, typed in PS3 gamepad, saw that the first result cost
less than £13 including postage, and just bought it and moved
on. Total time spent was about a minute.</p>
<p>Later I thought it was a bit cheap but ignored the thought on the
basis that the PS3 is ten years old and has been long replaced by the
PS4. The controller that game was the one above. In the following box.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/piratebox.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/piratebox.jpg"/>
<p>Initial impressions were that it was a little light and the D-pad was
different than I remember. However, it is probably been 5 years since
I touched an official PS3 gamepad and maybe they made production
improvements to make it lighter or I didn’t really remember right.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I plugged it in, and typed <cite>dmesg</cite>, the controller
itself confessed to its real identity.:</p>

<p>The controller was totally fake!</p>
<p>So it didn’t help me generalise my software. Also these controllers
contain a Lithium battery so I am not comfortable putting this
counterfeit device in my child’s hands. If they are so far beyond the
legal system that they do not need to care about the trademarks of
Sony, how much do they care about electrical safety? Or chemical
safety?</p>
<p>So I emailed my findings to the seller and they gave me an immediate
refund and didn’t need to send the controller back. A counterfeiter
with great customer service! Bizarre.</p>
<p>It is amazing the level of detail they went to. It is itself an
interesting cultural artefact; a Chinese made plastic product
pretending to be a different Chinese made plastic product. It is
interesting philosophical discussion about if you use the same design,
make it in the same place and maybe even use the exact same parts,
what does genuine actually mean?</p>
<p>And what the heck is the markup on the official Sony controller if
another company can make an almost exact replica for a less than a
third of the price?</p>
<p>It is shame that people feel the need to be dishonest. A third party
PS3 controller does not need to hide its true nature. I love my Argos
one which has some useful extra features.</p>
<p>Surely selling the controller as what it is would be simpler than
having to sneak around and recreate accounts constantly on the auction
site?</p>
<p>If the manufacturer had said, “this is a PS3 compatible gamepad and it
is three times cheaper”, then it could find its own market. While you
are at it, put in a higher capacity battery and better bluetooth
aerial than Sony’s controller and win on both price and quality.</p>
<p>As for me, I bought an official wired Xbox 360 controller from
Argos. I actually prefer the shape ergonomically and it is more
reliably detected by Linux and is much cheaper than the PS3 gamepad.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Building up Skynet</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/office.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/office.jpg"/>
<p>This has been a very exciting year. I burst out of the academy and
started a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.infomachine.uk/">new company</a> with a couple of other chaps called Rob and
Luke.</p>
<p>The idea is write a platform to help generate form-based applications,
which could absorb and display business data. We could then in the
future add machine learning/artificial intelligence type features, and
learn original ideas that have not been apparent without such
statistical modelling.</p>
<p>Basically we are trying to make Skynet, the singularity itself, which
we call Infomachine. Of course, being a start-up, it might evolve into
a different concept involving washing machines or something.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/infomachine.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/infomachine.png"/>
<p>Meanwhile, some customers found their way to us and we have been doing
lots of consulting and contract software development. The customers
themselves are highly intelligent and beautiful people who have
extensive domain knowledge in their own field, and it has been very
interesting learning some of this as we write software to make their
companies more efficient or expand into new areas.</p>
<p>This all feeds back into the eventual completion of the Infomachine,
or not; maybe we will go in a completely different direction, that is
the fun part, there are just three of us in a (often virtual) room and
we can do whatever the heck we like.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Everything is just C with bells on</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/dancer.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/dancer.jpg"/>
<p>In this post I thought about the world of cool that lies between
high-level languages and C. Thought is too strong, it is more of a
seed of a thought that has not germinated yet. This is not a fable
with a moral at the end.</p>
<p>When I first came across C#, I thought that is much better than Visual
Basic, perhaps Microsoft’s .Net platform could be interesting one day,
but not personally having an obvious project to use it in, I put it to
one side and have never touched it since.</p>
<p>When Vala was first announced, I thought wow, that is so sexy and I
played with it for about a week. Not personally having an obvious
project to use it in, I put it to one side and have never touched it
since.</p>
<p>I had pretty much the same reaction to Go (aka golang) - wow that’s
cool, perhaps not as sexy as Vala but I like the goroutines. I did the
trendy web based tour, I installed everything locally and played with
the standard library. Then, not personally having an obvious project
to use it in, I put it to one side and have never touched it since.</p>
<p>I could go on and on. Whatever piece of tech that comes into (or back
into) fashion seems to follow this pattern, Haskell, Erlang, Java,
Scala, etc etc. A lot of the developer tools industry and technology
media needs something shiny and new to promote this year.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love all this stuff, I would love to do projects
in different programming languages but obviously, as I have a
reputation for writing Python or JavaScript or doing system
administration, people hire me to do that and don’t perhaps think of
me for other things.</p>
<p>Maybe there is more too it than that, since in whatever I am doing, in
my head I seem to think of any algorithm in Python first as executable
pseudocode even if it gets typed in using JavaScript or another
language.</p>
<p>I had a long stint as an academic, but basically my whole career in
software is as a freelancer or contractor. A journeyman who works to
live.</p>
<p>Often the customer has an existing project or specific library,
toolkit or team which pre-determines the choice of programming
language.</p>
<p>Otherwise, my usual process for creating software is to prototype it
in a high level language (normally always Python but sometimes
JavaScript). 90% of the time, once it works the customer has solved
their immediate problem and wants to move their focus onto their next
problem, which may not be software and may not involve paying
freelance programmers. Sad I know, thanks for all the fish, I am here,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XGX98OW4Rc">like the song says</a>, etc etc :)</p>
<p>When the prototype is working, there is a lot to be done to optimise
it and keep it as a Python application, and almost always there is
some specific other bottleneck (such as network, database or some
industrial requirement) that means that CPU usage is not the problem
and so cutting out the Python interpreter wouldn’t actually make much
difference in the short and medium time-frames that most companies
care about.</p>
<p>Indeed I have seen cases where the customer has gotten someone to
rewrite the prototype application in Java, and found that the new
version is actually slower. A lot of the heavy duty work in the Python
version was actually happening inside a C library that has been highly
optimised over the last 30 years; changing the dependency from that to
a poorly implemented Java library caused the poor performance.</p>
<p>If we imagine a Python application is like a commissioning a
photograph, a C app is commissioning a sculpture. You only do it when
you want something to really last or really be the core of something
fundamental for your future success.</p>
<p>All the above notwithstanding, the genius of Python’s initial design
is that once your application has taken a stable(ish) form, it is
normally pretty straightforward to convert the application to C.</p>
<p>Most of the standard library inherits Linux/Unix best practice (and
even the same function names) and a lot of the best external libraries
in Python are just wrappers around the C equivalents. You always have
the fully working Python application to test it against.</p>
<p>It takes a long time yes, going through line by line, but you are not
troubling the boundaries of computer science or software engineering
as we know it. I actually love those kind of cathartic jobs, but I am
a freak.</p>
<p>Apologies if I am stating the bleeding obvious, none of the above text
is news to anyone, any Python developer knows the same thing, however
it is the foundation for what follows.</p>
<p>So the real reason why I have not personally had an obvious project to
use a lot of these fashionable and ‘cool’ languages and toolkits is
that they fall in the luke-warm middle ground between the extremely
high-level Python (and JS/Ruby/LISP etc) and the low level C language.</p>
<p>For most use cases, all these middle ground languages are slower and
less portable than C. If you have decided on a re-implementation, then
it takes no longer to rewrite a Python project to C than to Go, Java,
C# or whatever, indeed it might often be quicker to C.</p>
<p>I have actually used C hardly at all, far less than I would like to
have done, but I have used these middle-ground languages even
less. Everything just stays in high level code.</p>
<p>So as I warned, I have no moral for this fable, no conclusion to
offer, it is just the beginnings of a thought that ran through my
brain, I like to think I will pick up this theme later, but I will
probably look back in five years to find I have put it to one side and
have never touched it since.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Managing Contacts in Emacs with BBDB</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/phonecall.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/phonecall.jpg"/>
<p>This post is about BBDB (Big Brother Database), which is the main
contacts application available for Emacs.</p>
<div class="section" id="contacts-application-for-emacs">
<h2>Contacts Application for Emacs</h2>
<p>BBDB is packaged within distributions, albeit quite old versions of it
are packaged within Debian at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Information about BBDB can be found at its <a class="reference external" href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/">Savannah homepage</a>, and
most importantly <a class="reference external" href="http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bbdb/">downloads are found here</a>. I wanted the latest
version so I downloaded it from there.</p>
<p>The latest versions (that begin with 3, e.g. 3.1.2) require Emacs 23
or 24, an older version of Emacs will require version 2 of BBDB;
although it is much nicer for other reasons to use the latest version
of Emacs that you can get.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bbdb.git/plain/README">README</a> gives full instructions to get set up. Basically, like
with most other Emacs libraries, you make the library available by
editing the ~/.emacs file and using the require function.</p>
<div class="highlight-scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">require</span> <span class="ss">'bbdb-loaddefs</span> <span class="s">"/path/to/bbdb/lisp/bbdb-loaddefs.el"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-format">
<h2>Storage Format</h2>
<p>Despite the name ending in DB, contacts are stored in a plain text
file at ~/emacs.d/bbdb (where ~ represents the user’s home directory).</p>
<p>It is worth knowing that each line in the file is a contact, which
takes the form of a vector, this is a LISP data type similar to a
JavaScript Array or Python list (but items are delimited with spaces
rather than commas).</p>
<p>If you ever edit the file by hand or with code you write yourself, it
is important to keep one item to a line, if a line break gets removed
then BBDB will reject the file until you fix it.</p>
<p>Since it is a plain text file, you can do back it up easily, sync it
between computers, write scripts that do things to it, track it with
git or whatever you can imagine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="importing-contacts">
<h2>Importing Contacts</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/adam.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/adam.jpg"/>
<p>If you already have a load of contacts somewhere, then the best way to
get started is to import them from there. I personally had a load of
contacts in Google Contacts that had been built up from my Gmail
account and Android phone.</p>
<p>I used a lovely little Python script called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deong/charrington">charrington</a> which grabbed
all the contacts from Google and added them to a bbdb file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-bbdb">
<h2>Using BBDB</h2>
<p>As always, M is for Meta which means Alt on an IBM-PC style keyboard.</p>
<p>Typing M-x bbdb allows you to search for a contact. So if I search for
Elizabeth, I get this contact:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/bbdb.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/bbdb.png"/>
<p>The other commands all start with bbdb- for example, M-x bbdb-create
allows you to type in a new record. There is almost a hundred
commands, but you do not need to remember them. Using tab completion
shows them all, they are also organised in a toolbar menu.</p>
<p>If you have imported lots of contacts from Google Contacts, then
sometimes different pieces of information about a person are stored
under different names.</p>
<p>One of the most useful things is M-x bbdb-search-duplicates, this
allows you to merge contacts together and/or delete duplicate contacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-mail">
<h2>Sending Mail</h2>
<p>When you have point over a record, pressing m will allow you to
compose an email to the person. Emacs then drops you into message mode.</p>
<p>Email in Emacs is another topic entirely, but if you put the following
into your ~/.emacs file then you have setup the absolute basics:</p>
<div class="highlight-scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">user-mail-address</span> <span class="s">"youremail@example.com"</span>
    <span class="nv">user-full-name</span> <span class="s">"Your Name"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have a mail transport agent or relay (such as mstmp) setup then
Emacs can pass the email to whatever is pointed to by
/usr/sbin/sendmail or you can use Emacs <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/smtpmail/Emacs-Speaks-SMTP.html">itself to relay email</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-features">
<h2>Other features</h2>
<p>Pressing simply e edits the current line. ; allows you to write an
attached note. If the record has a www field then W displays the web
page.</p>
<p>You can even phone your contacts directly from Emacs! Typing M-d will
phone the current contact; obviously you need to have a modem or some
other kind of phone system setup.</p>
<p>Various mail and news packages for Emacs can make use of your contacts
to provide auto-fill functions, e.g. in the To: field of an email.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Manually Fulfilling Dependencies on Debian</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/atlas.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/atlas.png"/>
<p>msmtp is yet another Mail Transfer Agent that merely relays the
outgoing email message to another (e.g. your ISP’s) SMTP server. There
seems to be quite a lot of these, but this one seems to be the most
actively maintained - <a class="reference external" href="http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/">see its homepage on sourceforge</a> for more
information and documentation. At time of writing, the last stable
release is March 9, 2014 which is very recent.</p>
<p>Other similar ones, such as ssmtp, esmtp and nbsmtp, still seem to
work, they are pretty simple programs with few dependencies apart from
the C environment which basically never changes anymore and they are
recompiled and repackaged regularly by the distributions.</p>
<p>I have a machine running on Debian stable but wanted a newer version
of msmtp than is packaged for stable. So I cloned the source code
using git and compiled it.</p>
<p>However, after removing the default mail transfer agent (Exim),
Debian’s apt command is desperate to re-install it.</p>
<p>So I needed to tell the system that I already have a mail transfer
agent. This post explains how I did it. I don’t know if this is the
correct ‘modern’ way to do it, but it worked for me, and it is quite
interesting because it exposes a little of how Apt works under the
hood.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my problem is the use case given in the old Apt Howto
under the section called
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-helpers.en.html">4.1 How to install locally compiled packages: equivs</a> there is
more useful information there.</p>
<p>The package that helps us to circumvent Debian package dependencies is
called equivs, so first I needed to install that.  sudo apt-get
install equivs</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>sudo apt-get install equivs
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next I ran the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>equivs-control msmtp-git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This created a template Debian control file. I gave it a meaningful
name, i.e. msmtp installed from git.</p>
<p>I added the following lines:</p>
<div class="highlight-control"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="k">Package</span><span class="w">: </span><span class="s">msmtp-git</span>
<span class="k">Provides</span><span class="w">: </span><span class="s">mail-transport-agent</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <cite>Provides</cite> line is the key, it tells the system that a
mail-transport-agent is installed.</p>
<p>Then I created a .deb from this control file.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>equivs-build msmtp-git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Lastly I installed the deb:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>sudo dpkg --install  msmtp-git_1.0_all.deb
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Pretty weird but it works.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>A Distributed Global Textual Community</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/raindeer.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/raindeer.png"/>
<p>In the digital humanities when a scholar wants to transcribe and edit
texts such as ancient or medieval manuscripts, that scholar uses her
institution’s own systems (for the rest of this post I will call this
a ‘site’).</p>
<p>In Birmingham we have the Workspace for collaborative editing that I
was the main coder on, this provides editing and analysis facilities
for digital text projects hosted or associated with the University of
Birmingham in some way. There are several of these kind of sites,
maybe even dozens.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/">Textual Communities</a> is another such site, based at the University of
Saskatchewan, wherever that is, however, the difference is that
Textual Communities aims to “provide an infrastructure and tools to
allow anyone, anywhere, interested in a text to contribute to its
study, as part of a community working together.”</p>
<p>Here is a photo of some of the main Textual Communities people:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/textualcomm.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/textualcomm.png"/>
<p>So as part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://estoria.bham.ac.uk/">Estoria de Espanna Project</a>, I have been using
Textual Communities and integrating it somewhat with some display and
analysis tools on a server in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Part of the vision from the Textual Communities people is to build a
global editing community, which would imply being an open and
distributed system, not being based on one server.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are performance and reliability drawbacks to
relying on a single server in Canada to hold the data and pass it back
and forth in real time over HTTP.</p>
<p>So the first immediate approach I have taken is to use database
replication.</p>
<div class="section" id="master-slave-model">
<h2>1. Master/slave model</h2>
<p>The immediate steps to make Birmingham back up the Canadian site is a
simple and low level approach and it is a master/slave model.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Master = Canadian Server</p>
<p>Slave = Birmingham server</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>1. Every Hour, the slave server checks that the connecting SSH tunnel
is still up, if it is not it re-establishes it. The SSH tunnel can be
broken by server reboots or network issues.</p>
<p>2. Every time a write happens on the master server, the slave copies
it automatically.</p>
<p>3. The code that builds the edition (the public frontend that is one
of the key project outputs) works from the local copy of the database
which is far more efficient, and if the master goes down, the data is
still available locally.</p>
<p>This takes us 50% of the way but there is a big step missing. You
cannot actually write data to the slave without breaking the approach,
if master is down, and you start writing in the slave, there is no
automatic way to get the changes back.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t scale very easily, adding a new site to the global
textual community is a completely manual process. Beyond three or four
institutions it would be a serious labour cost in maintaining the
whole thing.</p>
<p>So sooner or later, you need to design a high level approach. The rest
of this post is what I have been studying and building little test
prototypes for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-textual-communities-distribution-system">
<h2>2. A textual communities distribution system</h2>
<p><cite>Caveat emptor</cite>: So this the approach I have been working on, it may not be the
approach favoured in the end by the Estoria project or Textual Communities.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/pacman.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/pacman.png"/>
<p>Versions of data can be written at different sites and shared between
them, yet what is considered the ‘approved’ or ‘best’ or ‘current’
version may be different at different sites.</p>
<p>Therefore the key to making textual communities into a distributed
system is to separate the sharing of versions from the interpretation
of these versions.</p>
<p>Each site must therefore keep an additional file/directory form of the
data for use by the distribution system. These are plain-text files
that can be easily backed up and easily analysed (a similar format to
the existing textual communities API, see below).</p>
<p>The actual textual community software does not have to be run from
these files, e.g. the Canadian site which uses MySQL can carry on
doing so, but the internal changes to the database are exported in
real time to plain text files in the data directory.</p>
<p>Likewise, changes by other sites can then be read into Canadian MySQL
database from the data files (which changes are accepted and applied
is subject to its merge algorithm, see below).</p>
<p>The data files are organised in a three level directory structure. The
naming of the directories can be interpreted in different ways:</p>
<p>According to an SQL database approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>database_name/table_name/row_id/</div></blockquote>
<p>Or in a document oriented approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>database_name/collection/document/</div></blockquote>
<p>Or in object oriented way:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>object_name_space/object_type/object_id/</div></blockquote>
<p>Inside the lowest level directory are files, each file is a version of
the data fragment expressed in (or at least wrapped) in JSON. The
system of distribution does not actually care what fields are inside
the file.</p>
<p>For example, a transcription of a page in the textual communities API
is already expressed in this format with a field called “text” which
contains the TEI XML text, as well as other fields (id, user, doc,
create_date, commit_date, prev, next).</p>
<p>The first version of this data file would be named like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>textual_communities/transcripts/1688800/1.json</div></blockquote>
<p>New versions are written according to a principle called
copy-on-write. When a new version is written, the old file is left
alone, the new file is called:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>textual_communities/transcripts/1688800/2.json</div></blockquote>
<p>There is also a symbolic link called ‘current’, this points to what is the
current canonical version of the data (for this particular site).</p>
<p>Different people at different sites can generate new versions of the
file, which are automatically shared using <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. However, what
‘current’ points to depends on a site specific algorithm.</p>
<p>The simplest algorithm is to point current at the file with the
highest integer in the file name, however, sites with editors and
crowd sourcing etc will not do that, current will only be re-pointed
when the editor (the scholar) has approved it.</p>
<p>Groups of sites can have the same of or different algorithms, it does not
affect the system of distribution.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/gitbranch.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/gitbranch.png"/>
<p>Since data files are tracked and shared using git, this creates metadata
that can be used to power a user-friendly web frontend for editors to
see new versions, approve/disapprove them and look at history.</p>
<p>When a new version is approved by the local editor, current is repointed
to the new file, if the version is not approved, it is just
ignored. Undoing a new version is moving current to the older file,
the rejected change is just ignored.</p>
<p>Using plain files and git solves many problems with crowd sourcing and
distributed editing without having to write the software ourselves.</p>
<p>When the files are used, e.g. they are loaded into the Canadian site’s
MySQL database, the file pointed to by current is uploaded, the other
files can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>Git has an event based system known as ‘hooks’. So for example, when a
new version of a file is created at a site, various actions can
happen, such as notifying the relevant local editors that a newer
version is available and can be approved or ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beyond-textual-communities-digital-editions">
<h2>3. Beyond Textual Communities - Digital Editions</h2>
<p>While it is somewhat parochial to talk about the project I am working
on, others in the global “Textual Communities” may have the same
aspirations and problems. Eventually you want to take the live form of
the text and turn it into digital editions.</p>
<p>The previous projects I was working on used Python and MongoDB for
serverside applications, but increasingly I am using IndexedDB,
Javascript and HTML5 to make the local browser do the work and allow
the user to continue offline.</p>
<p>These data directories can, more or less, be exposed via the web server
to Javascript as is, just with a few bits of censoring any relevant
private information. This is several orders of magnitude more
efficient than an application server like Django or Ruby on rails
serving the data.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/bplustree.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/bplustree.png"/>
<p>I have been working on a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B+tree">B+Tree</a> representation of the Estoria de
Espanna project data to provide search and a fast web frontend, these
can be read directly from the data files.</p>
<p>A fast web server like Nginx throwing out static files combined with
B+tree index for searches is pretty much unbeatable in terms of
performance. It is also pretty future proof - stupid lasts longer than
clever! The importance of this cannot be overstated in externally
funded projects that exist for their period of project funding and
then afterwards are maintained on a while-we-can basis.</p>
<p>Also, I am hoping to produce native mobile applications as part of the
Estoria project output, compiling an abridged version of the data
files directly into the app is far easier and has far better
performance than trying to port web application code to a phone by
statically linking in a Python interpreter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-end-of-the-beginning">
<h2>4. The End of the Beginning</h2>
<p>Somebody might come up with something better and the Textual
communities probably have their own strong ideas, but this is
where my thoughts and experiments are at now.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Modern Mounting with Udisks2</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/mounted.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/mounted.jpg"/>
<p>In this post we look at the changes in disk mounting and then look at
the udisksctl command which allows you to automount disks from the
command line. Feel free to skip past the background info if you just
want to learn how to use the command.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the beginning (Thursday, 1 January 1970?) to add a storage device
(such as a hard disk) to a computer was an infrequent affair, and
required the machine to be turned off.</p>
<p>So the classic system of disk mounting on a Posix (‘Unix-like’) system
was for the system administrator to list all the disks in a plain text
file systems table, which on most systems can be found in the file
/etc/fstab.</p>
<p>Nowadays servers often have the ability to add and remove disks
without turning the machine off. Even in desktop computers, SATA
drives have this facility too at least according to the SATA drive -
but it depends a lot on the manufacturer of motherboard controller
actually following the standard so it is not usually worth the risk.</p>
<p>The main thing that has really brought hotplugging into use is
external disks such as USB drives and other trendy connectors that
come and (mostly) go such as Firewire, eSata, Thunderbolt, etc.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/duck.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/duck.jpg"/>
<p>In the early 2000s, the first attempt to cope with this was called
HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer, which did what it said on the tin,
provided a layer between device nodes and the user of the nodes, so
storage devices (and other hardware) can be added and removed without
rebooting this system and without rewriting the /etc/fstab file.</p>
<p>Then everything gets replaced a dizzying number of times (DeviceKit,
devfs, etc) as better approaches are discovered in a fast moving
period of hardware development, udev eventually won and was the main
thing for the rest of the decade.</p>
<p>When a device is added or removed from the system, the Linux kernel
notices and sends out an event. Udev is a daemon that waits around
listening for these events and then responding accordingly. udev runs
in user space not kernel space which is good for security as you
cannot plug in a USB stick and take over the kernel like on some
proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>In 2012, the <a class="reference external" href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hotplug.devel/17392">udev project merged</a> into the systemd project; systemd is
the next generation (or current generation for some distributions)
system and service manager. Systemd is really cool and is being
adopted by most of the major distributions but it is still a year or
two away in some cases depending on their release cycles.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that if you want to control disks on the command
line and you are using the mount command you are 20 years out of
date. Enough history, lets get to the flesh.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/usb.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/usb.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-line-usage">
<h2>Command Line Usage</h2>
<p>When you hot plug disks in the system, the graphical interface
automatically reacts and provides buttons to mount, unmount and so
on. However, if you have accessed a machine remotely, or just like to
use the command line, then this post will tell you how to use the same
automounting approach as the GUI.</p>
<p>For a system controlled by udev (or systemd), one command line tool is
called udisks. It has two versions, in the original version 1, the
command is udisks, for the second version udisks2, it is udisksctl.</p>
<p>If you don’t have these commands already installed then you will have
to install the udisks2 or udisks packages. In the case of the Debian
distribution, udisks is in Wheezy and udisks2 is in Jessie. I seem to
have both installed for some reason, possibly because I started at
Wheezy and upgraded to Jessie.</p>
<p>Anyway, we will look at the newest one, udisksctl.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="udisksctl">
<h2>udisksctl</h2>
<p>The main commands follow, there are several more that can be seen with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl <span class="nb">help</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see a list of disks attached to the system:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl status
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For a very in depth list of disk information:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl dump
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To mount a filesystem:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You don’t need to give a location, it will sort that out automatically
for you. On my system it mounts the disk at /media/username/label
where username is obviously your username and label is the label of
the disk partition, other distributions may deal with it differently.</p>
<p>To unmount a filesystem:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdb1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the command is unmount with an N, not umount like the
classic command.</p>
<p>Note that these command names autocomplete which is kinda cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="udisks">
<h2>udisks</h2>
<p>The old udisks command is pretty similar except instead of giving a command
name, you give an argument, e.g. to get the full disk information:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisks --dump
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Instead of status, it has –enumerate. This option lists partitions instead
of physical disks like in the newer udisksctl.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="go-forth-and-mount">
<h2>Go forth and mount</h2>
<p>So udisksctl is pretty cool, we can now mount and unmount disks from
the command line in the same way as the GUI. Do remember that the disk
information from the udisksctl dump command can quite be useful when
wanting to know about the disks attached to a system.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Python’s Disappearing Long Type</h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/robotspider.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/robotspider.png"/>
<p><em>Note: everything below refers to the default (missionary position) C
implementation of Python.</em></p>
<p>If you are converting Python code from Python 2 to Python 3, you might
notice that the conversion tool transforms any uses of <em>long()</em> into
<em>int()</em>. If that confuses you, this post will hopefully make it clear.</p>
<p>Before Python 2.2, there was a clear distinction between two of the
Python numerical types, the <em>int</em> type and the Python <em>long</em> type.</p>
<p>Firstly, Python’s <em>int</em> type was implemented as a signed long. So a Python
<em>int</em> takes 32 bits of memory, which while not as efficient as some
really optimised approach using shorter types, is still very fast
indeed.</p>
<p>Secondly, Python’s <em>long</em> type is an integer of unlimited size (well until you
run of RAM - which would be an unrealistically massive number not
useful for anything).</p>
<p>Python’s <em>long</em> type does not map directly to a C type, it is a custom
type implemented in the Python source code somewhere which I guess
uses a C struct or whatever. As you might imagine, using the Python
<em>long</em> type is significantly more RAM intensive and slower than the Python
<em>int</em> type, but in reality it is rarely a problem (see below).</p>
<p>Hans Fangohr <a class="reference external" href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/blog/performance-of-pythons-long-data-type.html">did a little performance testing</a> and found that
Python’s long type is about three times slower than the Python’s <em>int</em>
type.</p>
<p>Unified <em>ints</em> were <a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0237/">brought in for Python 2.2</a>. This starts off as a
Python <em>int</em> but transforms magically to a Python <em>long</em> if it needs
to. Here is how it works in Python 2.2 to 2.7:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775807</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775808L</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'long'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">long</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'long'&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that when we add 1 to sys.maxsize, the result has an L suffix to
denote it is a Python <em>long</em> and no longer a 32 bit number.</p>
<p>In Python 3, it works in a similar the way, however the fact you are
no longer using a 32 bit type is now completely hidden away from the
user:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775807</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775808</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">long</span>
<span class="gt">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span class="nb">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="m">1</span>, in <span class="n">&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span class="gr">NameError</span>: <span class="n">name 'long' is not defined</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This time, when we add 1 to sys.maxsize, the result has no L suffix;
trying to call the long constructor function causes an exception
because it does not exist anymore in Python 3.</p>
<p>Of course, the fun of Python is that being a high level language, we
normally don’t really care as long a we get a number; this is it
rightly got changed it to be one unified type.</p>
<p>One might design a high performance application not to use the Python
<em>long</em> type if it turns out to be a bottleneck. However, normally you
would have other bigger insurmountable bottlenecks in your
software/hardware/network stack so you don’t care about this.</p>
<p>However, if you are working on a multi-language project, especially if
you are using Python alongside a lower level language like C, then it
is useful to know what is going on underneath the Python types.</p>
<p>The Python float type is implemented as a C double. This doesn’t
change across versions. Several other numeric types are available in
Python of course.</p>
<p>So if you see <em>long</em> being converted to <em>int</em> by the 2to3 conversion
tool, now you know why.</p>

<p>In this post we will example the digital text and how and why it is encoded.</p>
<div class="section" id="denarius">
<h2>Denarius</h2>
<p>Wars are often an unexpected event, and a lot of the major currency
developments in the 19th and 20th centuries were due to wars. In the
ancient world it was no different. The requirement to quickly gather
resources required an efficient form of money.</p>
<p>During the Second Punic War, in 211 BC, Rome brought out the Denarius,
which means ‘containing ten’ - because one silver Denarius was worth
ten bronze (later copper) Asses.</p>
<p>During the Third Punic war, in 140 BC, Rome decided to go hexadecimal,
where one silver-coloured Denarius became worth 16 copper Asses.</p>
<p>The silver-coloured Denarius was considered a day’s wages for a
soldier. The gold-coloured Solidus varied in value but eventually
stabilised by the 8th century as 12 denarii.</p>
<p>The Romans carried spread currency around and in Britain, the denarius
became the penny but was still written as d until 1971 e.g. 5d for 5
pence.</p>
<p>12d made a shilling, which is the Anglo-Saxon term for the
Solidus. The shilling was in the 16th century pegged to the value of a
cow in Kent market.</p>
<p>Twenty shilling made a pound which was named after the unit of mass, a
pound in cash was originally worth the value of a pound weight of silver
(which is now about £300).</p>
<p>The pound of a unit of mass is itself Roman of course, from libra,
which is why pound is shortened to lb. The pound £ sign was originally
an L. 1 lb in mass is 16 ounces.</p>
<p>Part the deal when Britain applied to join the European Economic
Community in the 1960s and 1970s, was that we got rid of all these
crazy measurements and adopted metric, also known as scientific
measurements, which we did eventually, to a certain extent. For
example, milk, beer and cider are officially sold in units of 568 mL!</p>
<p>So until recently, the idea of non-base 10 measurements was completely
normal.</p>

<p>George Boole was a theologian who was also one of the greatest
mathematicians of the 19th Century.Boole understood mathematics and
religion as intertwined. George Boole believed that studying
mathematics would help reveal a new understanding of God.</p>

<p>The core idea that all knowledge and thought could be reduced to two
factors nothing (0) and God (1), had long been discussed, for example
by the the Jesuit Gottfried Leibniz writing in the 17th
Century. However, Boole had the mathematical knowledge to take the
idea and build a complete system of logic around it.</p>

<p>Traditionally, eight bits was called a byte (more correctly it is an
octet). Four bits is a nibble.</p>
<p>A computer processor has lots of microscopic transistors. The CPU in
my laptop (the Intel Ivy Bridge) has 1.4 billion of them. Each
transistor is like a switch with an on and off state.</p>

<h2>Hexadecimal</h2>
<p>Binary is very low level. The first level of abstraction over binary is called hexadecimal.</p>
<p>In previous lecture, we looked at how and when and where computing was
developed. These early computer developers choose the most efficient
representation. As we mentioned earlier, until recently non-base 10
measurements were completely normal.</p>
<p>Hexadecimal (‘hex’ for short) is counting in base 16, here is the
table from above with hex as well:</p>

<p>Now it is easy to convert any binary number to hex. You just split it
up into nibbles from the right.</p>
<p>So this number:</p>
<p>11111011110</p>
<p>Split up is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="mi">0111</span> <span class="mi">1101</span> <span class="mi">1110</span>
  <span class="mi">7</span>    <span class="n">d</span>    <span class="n">e</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So in hex it is 7de.</p>
<p>What number is it in decimal? Well that is more complicated. Going
from binary to decimal requires you to split the binary number up into
parts:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>10000000000 1024
1000000000   512
100000000    256
10000000     128
1000000       64
10000         16
1000           8
100            4
10             2

1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = ?
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So data is electrical impulses in a transistor, which represent 1 and
0, which are then hexadecimal numbers.</p>
<p>Now we have numbers, we can now encode characters. Each character is given a hex number.</p>
<p>So 41 in hex (which is 65 in decimal) is “latin capital letter A”.</p>
<p>There are different encodings (mapping between numbers and characters)
but the only one that really matters in 2014 is called UTF-8 commonly
called Unicode (although there are other forms of Unicode which did
not win).</p>
<p>UTF-8 has room for 1,112,064 different characters and symbols which
aim to represent all of the world’s languages.</p>
<p>The first 128 characters are carried over from an older standard
called ASCII. The first 32 of these are historic control characters
for controlling printers and teletype devices (remember those from a
previous lecture?).</p>
<p>20 in hex (so 32 in decimal) is the empty space, then we get
punctuation, then we get the numbers and so more punctuation etc then
the letters in upper case then some more symbols then the letters in
lower case etc.</p>
<p>This gets us to 7E (126) which is ~, and we have all of the English
keyboard covered. The next 129 characters are Western European
languages (German etc) and then it carries on after that through all
the world’s letters and symbols.</p>
<p>Including some really fun stuff added to give compatibility with
Japanese mobile phones:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f4a9/index.htm">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f4a9/index.htm</a>

<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji</a></p>
<p>So a digital text is a series of these hexadecimal numbers representing
characters and symbols including spaces (20 in hex/32 in decimal) and
control codes such as line breaks (0A in hex, 10 in decimal) and so
on.</p>
<p>Here is a nice chart version of the first 127 (ASCII) characters:
<a class="reference external" href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html">http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html</a></p>
<p>So you can decode these characters (with some spaces added to make it
simpler):</p>
<p>41 6e 64 20 74 68 65 72 65 66 6f 72 65 20 6e 65 76 65 72 20 73 65 6e
64 20 74 6f 20 6b 6e 6f 77 20 66 6f 72 20 77 68 6f 6d 20 74 68 65 20
62 65 6c 6c 20 74 6f 6c 6c 73 3b 20 49 74 20 74 6f 6c 6c 73 20 66 6f
72 20 74 68 65 65 2e</p>
<p>To make it clear that something is a hex value, it is often prefixed
with 0x or x or U+.</p>
<p>This is as good as it far as it goes. But to make practical use of the
data, just loads of text doesn’t help that much.</p>
<p>If we want to make a digital representation of a humanities artefact
like a manuscript, we need to use a file format. Otherwise the digital
text is of limited use for other scholars and software.</p>

<p>The TEI was initially SGML based then became XML based. What this
means is that the text of the artefact is typed up, and meaning and extra information is inserted into the text using angle brackets.</p>
<p>An example of a text encoded using the TEI format:
<a class="reference external" href="http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/718/1/47.xml">http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/718/1/47.xml</a></p>
<p>So in this simple line here:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"6"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">testimonium</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The element &lt;w&gt; which means word, has an attribute n with value 6
which quite obviously tells us that it is word number 6. The text of
the word then follows, and then the word ends with a closing tag: &lt;/w&gt;</p>
<p>As explained in the preface to the TEI guidelines, part of the reason
for them was to enable sharing of data and a new generation of shared
TEI-supporting software to emerge.</p>
<p>Sadly that never really happened. The problem with the TEI is that it
is a huge standard that doesn’t really simplify the problem space in
any way. There are hundreds of available elements and every author of
a TEI document uses their own subset it in his/her own way.</p>
<p>Churchill famously said that “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”</p>
<p>TEI is the worst form of encoding, except for all the other forms that have been tried from time to time.</p>

<h2>Trams: a case study in technology</h2>
<p>In 1700, what we now call South Birmingham was a patchwork of small
subsistence tenant farms, but as people left the land to work in
factories and other industrial jobs, these farms gradually became larger.</p>
<p>Here is a map of Birmingham in 1831, as you can see South Birmingham
does not really exist yet. The built up areas are what is now known as
the city centre:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/birmingham1831.png"><img alt="Image of Birmingham in 1831" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/birmingham1831_small.png"/></a>
<p>One of these larger farms was called the Grange Estate, in the
following image, Isaac Bate and his family pose outside the farmhouse
in 1876:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/batesfamily.png"><img alt="Image of a Grange Farmhouse" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/batesfamily_small.png"/></a>
<p>At the turn of the 20th Century, there was a massive housing boom and
the Grange Estate was bought in 1895 and zoned for housing and roads.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/grangeplan.png"><img alt="../../../_images/grangeplan_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/grangeplan_small.png"/></a>
<p>It is like Sim-City, everything needed for the good life is provided,
including shops and the important combination of a church and a
brewery.</p>
<p>Victorian industrial workers would walk or cycle along quiet
tree-lined avenues and then take the tram and train for longer
distance travelling.</p>
<p>So far so good. You will notice there is no car parks, no off street
parking, no garages. The total number of cars in the world was at this
point was approximately 25, most of which were Benz hand made cars in
Germany.</p>
<p>However, after the war, the brave new world required that the trees,
train station and tramlines were all removed to make more space for
the motorcar.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/morrisminor.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/morrisminor_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/morrisminor_small.png"/></a>
<p>The Grange Estate is now overflowing with cars, and the Alcester Road is
a traffic jam for much of the day. Traffic accidents are the leading cause of
death for children and Birmingham is one of the most obese cities in Europe.</p>
<p>Car ownership in Birmingham peaked at 50% of households, one of the
highest rates of car ownership for a large city. There is not, and
never will be, enough space for everyone to own a car in dense urban
areas like Birmingham.</p>
<p>Cars socially exclude people who do not own them, and are dangerous to
people walking and cycling, and prevent community building as you
cannot talk to other residents while stuck in a small metal box.</p>
<p>There are currently 380,000 cars in Birmingham (8000 are added every
year). As the population of Birmingham is predicted to continue
growing, the car is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The council
have produced a plan:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/birmingham_transport_plan.png"><img alt="../../../_images/birmingham_transport_plan_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/birmingham_transport_plan_small.png"/></a>
<p>You guessed it, the plan is to reopen the train stations and put the trams
back. Getting us precisely back to where we were in 1896.</p>
<p>The new Birmingham trams have a maximum capacity of 210. Cars in Birmingham
have an average occupancy rate of 1.2.</p>
<p>A car driven for an hour every day, spends 4% of its time in use,
96% of its time rusting and getting in the way.</p>
<p>Cars are overproduced and inefficiency used. However, this
overproduction has provided large numbers of good jobs - 145,000 in
the UK alone currently work in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>If everyone moves to trains, trams and bikes, where do the jobs come from?</p>
<p>If Birmingham gets its comprehensive tram network, it needs just 120 tram sets to provide transport for the whole city (service every 6 minutes each way).</p>
<p>What does Birmingham’s 60 year love affair with the car tell us about
technology?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Increased technological efficiency destroys jobs (while creating
others).</li>
<li>Sometimes you have to go “back to the future”</li>
<li>Not all new technologies are necessarily a good idea</li>
<li>Technology is never un-invented, everything survives somewhere but
the rate of growth or decline is the important thing to notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The history of the computer is much like the history of the tram.</p>
</div>

<h2>The real history of computing (short version)</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/jacquard_loom.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/jacquard_loom_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/jacquard_loom_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The first programmable object is the Jacquard Loom in 1801, it used
punch cards which allowed different weaving patterns.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Ada_Lovelace.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Ada_Lovelace_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Ada_Lovelace_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The digital age almost begins in 1843, when Lady Ada Lovelace (the
daughter of poet Lord Byron) wrote the first computer programme,
algorithm for Charles Babbage Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli
numbers.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/adalovelaceplaque.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/adalovelaceplaque_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/adalovelaceplaque_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The programme was written as part of a set of examples of what could
be run on Charles Babbage’s computer the Analytical Engine. Sadly, the
British government decided to cancel his research funding so this
machine was never finished, but it would have been the first general
purpose digital computer.</p>
<p>Here is his earlier machine called the difference engine:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Babbage_Difference_Engine_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Babbage_Difference_Engine_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The digital age tries to begin again in 1936 when Alan Turing explains
in a seminar paper that any real-world general-purpose computer or
computer language can approximately simulate any other real-world
general-purpose computer or computer language, i.e. it is “Turing
complete”.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/Alan_Turing_photo.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Alan_Turing_photo.jpg"/>
<p>Turing went on to create this, the Bombe, a machine designed to
decipher encrypted German messages during World War II.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Bletchley_Park_Bombe.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Bletchley_Park_Bombe_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Bletchley_Park_Bombe_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The successor was called Colossus, and is starting to be a
recognisable computer.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/colossus.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/colossus_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/colossus_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>Alan Turing was not appreciated during his lifetime, to put it lightly. However, now he is a man of many memorials, including these:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Alan_Turing_Olympic_Torch.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Alan_Turing_Olympic_Torch_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Alan_Turing_Olympic_Torch_small.jpg"/></a>

<p>After that we have the first non-military computer, the Manchester
Mark I in 1949, and pretty much from here the digital age has begun.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/mark1.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/mark1_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/mark1_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The next image shows the Atlas, also at the University of Manchester,
the world’s most powerful computer in 1962. It had more computer
capacity than the rest of the United Kingdom put together.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/University_of_Manchester_Atlas,_January_1963.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/University_of_Manchester_Atlas,_January_1963_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/University_of_Manchester_Atlas,_January_1963_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>This is the 1970 PDP-11 operated here by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/pdp11.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/pdp11_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/pdp11_small.png"/></a>
<p>Thompson is sitting at a teletype terminal. Where you code into
the keyboard and the computer responds by printing out the result.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Teletype_with_papertape_punch_and_reader.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Teletype_with_papertape_punch_and_reader_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Teletype_with_papertape_punch_and_reader_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>Shortly afterwards, video terminals were invented. Such as this one:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/DEC_VT100_terminal.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/DEC_VT100_terminal_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/DEC_VT100_terminal_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>It may look like a computer, but it is actually just a screen and a
keyboard, all the processing happens in the mainframe computer
elsewhere.</p>
<p>These type of computers can and normally did had multiple terminals,
sometimes in other rooms or other buildings.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Digital.PDP-11.1970.102646128.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Digital.PDP-11.1970.102646128_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Digital.PDP-11.1970.102646128_small.png"/></a>
<p>In the 1970s, it was called time-sharing. Hundreds or thousands of
terminals could share the same mainframe - which would be maintained
and updated by specialists.</p>
<p>I love this next photo, the guy in the front looks like he has the
universal programmer’s tense expression, i.e. ‘Why the heck is this not
working now?’.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/ctrlroom-1.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/ctrlroom-1_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/ctrlroom-1_small.png"/></a>
<p>These mainframes ran an operating system called Unix started by
Thompson and Ritchie. The different terminal users could communicate
with each other and collaborate.</p>
<p>The terminals got smarter over time, and even had graphical front ends
that looked something like this:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/cde.png"><img alt="../../../_images/cde_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/cde_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>This was the start of the modern era of computing. Many programs that were written in the 1970s are maintained today. There is a continuous thread that runs from Lovelace and Babbage, through Turing to the real beginning of the digital age in the 1970s.</p>
<p>So far so good. This is our tram. Next, comes the car, or indeed two of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="personal-computers">
<h2>1. Personal computers</h2>
<p>Here is an early attempt from 1969 to market a home computer.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/cook.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/cook.png"/>
<p>This particular model was a commercial failure.</p>
<p>When the PC came out, such this example from 1981, compared to the
Unix systems of the 1970s and 1980s, they were giant step backwards.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/IBM_PC_5150.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/IBM_PC_5150_small.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/IBM_PC_5150_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>No networking, a single process at once, focused on really dull office
tasks like typing a letter. The biggest problem looking back was the
software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-proprietary-software">
<h2>2. The rise of proprietary software</h2>
<p>Until this point, the source code of all programs had been shared
among the largely academic computing world. Everyone could study and
improve computer programs and share those improvements back to the
community.</p>
<p>With the new idea of proprietary software or closed source software,
you don’t legally own the software anymore, you have merely licensed
the right to use it under certain conditions.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Windows1.0.png"><img alt="../../../_images/Windows1.0_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Windows1.0_small.png"/></a>
<p>The source of the software is not shared, you just have compiled
(unreadable) copy of it. There can now be a difference on what you
think the software does (something useful) and what it actually does
e.g. spy on you.</p>
<p>When you understand this point, you suddenly a realise it is a bad
idea to licence or use any software that cannot be publicly peer
reviewed and fixed.</p>
<p>Proprietary software comes with multiple pages of legalese and asks
you to tick that you not only read it but also understand it. You have
to lie in order to start it, and goes downhill from there.</p>
<p>The Snowden revelations printed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">in the Guardian</a> have confirmed what
we already knew, that Microsoft software has built-in backdoors for
the NSA to spy on its users. Even scarier is that secret backdoors
created for Microsoft and the NSA could also be exploited by
criminals.</p>
<p>Proprietary software, especially in the form of Microsoft Windows, is
a temporary aberration in the history of the digital. In 50 years
time, Microsoft Windows will be considered as important as this
device:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/peppapig.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/peppapig.jpg"/>
<p>So lets get back to the trams. There were two massive and related
developments which happened almost in the background, but would come
to dominate the digital world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-free-open-source-software">
<h2>The rise of free/open source software</h2>
<p>In 1983, a famous programmer in MIT called Richard Stallman began the
‘Free Software’ movement. As well as being a well known software
developer (he invented the concept of a live real time text editor and
started the most widely used compiler today - GCC), he best known as a
digital philosopher.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/rms.jpg" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/rms.jpg"/>
<p>Stallman argued that software developers had a moral, ethical and
political duty to enable co-operation and prevent restrictions on the
ability of users to study, examine, peer review, modify and share
software. He argued that proprietary software was anti-social, corrupt
and ultimately self-defeating.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the difference between the terms
‘commercial’ and ‘proprietary’. Software can be ‘commercial’ -
i.e. made by a company for profit, with or without being
proprietary. Likewise a proprietary program may be made available at
cost or at no cost.</p>
<p>He illustrates the concept by comparing ‘a free beer’ with ‘free
speech’.</p>
<p>Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens created a later related concept called
‘open source’, which emphases the practical aspects rather than the
political and ethical ones. For example, the vast majority of software is
not created for sale in packaged boxes but is created use within
companies and institutions where software is not their primary
purpose. So if this software is shared and improved in a community, it
gives added value to those who engage in it.</p>
<p>Almost every major software development of the 1990s and 21st century
has happened within the Free Software/Open Source world including
Linux and Android.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the most famous piece of free/open source software
of them all, the World Wide Web.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-world-wide-web">
<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
<p>In the early 1990s, the best designed and most powerful information
protocol was called Gopher. However, despite its technical strengths,
Gopher eventually lost out because the copyright owner, the University
of Minnesota, wanted to sell it as proprietary software.</p>
<p>And finally a Brit again!</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/berners-lee.png"><img alt="../../../_images/berners-lee_small.png" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/berners-lee_small.png"/></a>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee created World Wide Web, which while technically
inferior to Gopher, was free software. Anyone could develop a server
or a client without having to ask or pay anyone for permission. When
WWW became widely shared in 1993, proprietary Gopher was toast. Gopher
was eventually re-licensed as free software in 2000, but it was too
late, WWW had taken over everything.</p>
<p>Finally, desktop computers had similar networking capabilities to
1970s mainframes. While they are a lot of people still using Windows,
these are merely like the 1970s dumb terminals, 83% of web servers are
running free software. Now with Apple OS X (based on FreeBSD Unix-like
system), Linux desktops like Ubuntu and the rise of Android based phones
and tablet (Android is based on the free software operating system
Linux), almost everyone is running a system which is based on the
1970s Unix. The 20 years of the Windows aberration is coming to a close.</p>
<p>Go Linux, go WWW, go Trams, go bikes!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academia-and-open-source-software">
<h2>Academia and Open Source Software</h2>
<p>Most UK and EU funding bodies now require that any software produced
in a research project is released as open source software. Software
developers within the academy, especially those in the humanities, are
unlikely to be allowed to large pay licensing fees and are expected to
use open source tools wherever possible.</p>
<p>Any project that uses the digital is likely to involve some open
source software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beyond-open-source">
<h2>Beyond Open Source</h2>
<p>The WWW has enabled collaboration in many areas, not just
software. Principles and ideas from open source have been applied to
other fields.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Freedom of Information - providing open access to government
documents through the Web</li>
<li>Open Access - unrestricted access via the Web to peer-reviewed
journal articles and primary data.</li>
<li>Crowd sourcing - creating content by soliciting contributions from
online communities - Wikipedia being a prominent example</li>
<li>Crowd funding - funding projects through soliciting contributions
from web users - e.g. Kickstarter</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digital-conduct">
<h2>Digital Conduct</h2>
<p>Collaborative and creative online communities are
self-selecting. People form communities to create something, should
they also be responsible for social justice?</p>
<p>Should these collaborative communities enabled by the web and by
free/open principles have standards of behaviour, if so what should
they be and who polices them?</p>
<p>Increasingly these creative communities have published codes of
conduct, especially regarding communication and discrimination.</p>
<p>Developing-world criticisms: does attempting to regulate conduct in
digital creative communities risk the danger of western (especially US
west-coast) cultural imperialism? How do diversity and social
policies relate to freedom of speech?</p>
<p>Does forcing participants to use real names instead of pseudonyms
cause problems for those with fear of harassment?</p>
<p>How should gender be dealt with in largely male dominated online
communities? Are those who run these communities responsible for
addressing gender imbalances?</p>
<p>Communities that work primarily online but have conferences or social
meetings pose particular issues in terms of harassment/unwanted
attention. E.g. conferences with male to female ratios of 10 to 1 are not
uncommon.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Three Crunchbang Linux Tips</h1>
<img alt="Image of Debian swirls in black and grey" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/debian-bulbs-by-omns.png"/>
<p>As <a class="reference external" href="http://zeth.net/2014/01/10/crunchbang.html">talked about previously</a>, my main computers currently have the
Crunchbang Linux distribution, which is a version of Debian GNU/Linux
using the Openbox window manager.</p>
<p>These tips might also be useful for some other Debian or Ubuntu based
systems.</p>
<div class="section" id="setting-the-keymap-for-an-apple-keyboard">
<h2>Setting the keymap for an Apple keyboard</h2>
<img alt="Image of Apple Keyboard with big keys" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/A1048_british_apple_keyboard.jpg"/>
<p>While laptops might need flat keys for portability (though I might
argue the point), I hate typing on them. I like full-sized keys, not
flaccid little flat ones.</p>
<p>I once bought an Apple Mac G4, I don’t use it anymore but I still use
the keyboard I bought for it. Using Linux, it is not too much of a
problem just to use the IBM layout without (i.e. remembering that the
double quote mark is above the 2 key for example) but it is worth
setting it properly in case someone else needs to use my computer.</p>
<p>I also have an Apple Macbook Pro laptop for work reasons which also
has the same key layout.</p>
<p>Anyway, I edited the file called /etc/default/keyboard and set the
following option:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">XKBVARIANT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"mac"</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I am in Great Britain, so I also need to be sure that the following
option is set:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>XKBLAYOUT=”gb”</div></blockquote>
<p>Maybe there was a way to change this using a graphical tool, but this
way worked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-screen-layouts-with-arandr">
<h2>Creating screen layouts with ARandR</h2>
<img alt="Image of ARandR Screen Layout Editor programme" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/arandr.png"/>
<p>ARandR Screen Layout Editor is a wonderful tool for setting up your
monitors.  You can drag them around, change the resolution and rotate
them in order to create your perfect screen layout.</p>
<p>To save the configuration, click on ‘Layout’ then ‘Save As’ to save a
particular configuration.</p>
<p>You can reload this configuration within the program, but the
configuration file is itself a simple shell script (which calls xrandr
with arguments representing what you have picked in the GUI).</p>
<p>So to automatically configure your screen layout when the graphical
session first starts, you can append the script to the file:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="o">~/.</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">openbox</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">autostart</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The fact that a configuration is just a shell script means you can
easily have multiple layouts for different situations, and either call
them yourself on the command line, assign desktop shortcuts or use
other tools to call them, e.g.  you can use cron to change the screen
configuration at a certain time or write an upstart/systemd script to
execute it based on some system event etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dealing-with-not-found-commands">
<h2>Dealing with not-found commands</h2>
<img alt="Image of glass smashing with Linux penguin looking through" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/tuxsmash.png"/>
<p>When using the command line in Ubuntu, if you try to call a
command/program that has not been installed, it says something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">program</span> <span class="s1">'tuxpaint'</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">currently</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">installed</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">You</span> <span class="n">can</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="n">typing</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">tuxpaint</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here is a more complicated example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">program</span> <span class="s1">'a2ensite'</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">currently</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">installed</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">You</span> <span class="n">can</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="n">typing</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">apache2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">common</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What actually happens here is a Python script appropriately named
command-not-found is called which then looks up what package is needed
to run the program.</p>
<p>If you want the same behaviour on Crunchbang, just do:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">command</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="ow">not</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">found</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The problem with this utility on older hardware is when you
accidentally make a typo that is actually a valid command somewhere,
you get a second or so delay while it searches Apt’s cache, which
could get annoying quite quickly.</p>
<p>If you want to search for a particular package, you can just use the
pre-installed apt-cache command, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cache</span> <span class="n">search</span> <span class="n">tuxpaint</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All the packages to do with tuxpaint are listed in the
terminal. However, this does not go down to the file level like
command-not-found does. For example, the other example of a2ensite
finds nothing:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">cache</span> <span class="n">search</span> <span class="n">a2ensite</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I don’t know a way of searching for a package by command using the
stock Crunchbang install. However, you can install the apt-file
package, which allows searches like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">file</span> <span class="n">search</span> <span class="n">filename</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Installing Multiple Versions of Firefox</h1>
<img alt="Iceweasel logo" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/500px-Iceweasel_icon.svg.png"/>
<p>8Y3U5AJRHKZ2</p>
<p>So I want to test my web application using multiple versions of Firefox,
especially the latest version, but I do not want to mess with my default system
version (which is in fact Iceweasel :).</p>
<p>You can make this as over-complicated as you like. The simple way is to ignore
apt and your system packaging system and run the test browser completely in user
space.</p>
<p>The downside of this is that you will not get automatic security updates, so
you have to keep an eye yourself for them and download new versions yourself.
On the bright side, the browser is running as an unprivileged user and you are
only testing your own site.</p>
<p>So you just download the archive from Mozilla. So I am using 64 bit Linux and
I speak British English, so I used the following URL:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">ftp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mozilla</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">pub</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">mozilla</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">firefox</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">releases</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">latest</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">linux</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">x86_64</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">en</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">GB</span><span class="o">/</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can edit the URL as appropriate and then unpack it e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">tar</span> <span class="n">jxf</span> <span class="n">firefox</span><span class="o">*.</span><span class="n">tar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bz2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Inside the new firefox directory there is an executable named, somewhat
unsurprisingly, firefox, call it in the following way:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="o">./</span><span class="n">firefox</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">no</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">remote</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">P</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will pop up a little dialogue that allows you to choose the user profile,
so create a new one:</p>
<img alt="Image of firefox user profile dialogue" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/firefox_user_profile_dialog.png"/>
<p>You can see I have created a profile called Firefox26. In this way, the new
Firefox version will not mess with the main system version. Click ‘Start
Firefox’ to launch it. Having a new profile for each test version will keep
things both sane and nicely decoupled.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Building Python from source on Debian or Ubuntu</h1>
<img alt="Cruchbang Linux Logo" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/500px-Python-logo-notext.svg.png"/>
<p>Python is available pre-built for more or less every platform and if you are
using Linux or Mac then you have it already. If you don’t know why would you want to build Python from source, then this post is probably not for you.</p>
<p>I wanted to test things on a newer version of Python than is currently available
in Debian stable. There are also things I want to improve in the standard
library, but sadly I do not have time for that at the present moment - but a man
is allowed to dream.</p>
<p>Building Python is explained in the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/devguide/setup.html">Python Developer’s Guide</a>. This post is a
commentary on that, and I am assuming you are using a Debian or Ubuntu based
operating system on your computer.</p>
<p>To start with you need the Mercurial source control management tool, commonly
known as hg. If you don’t have it, you can get it with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">mercurial</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you need to get the source code of Python, as the developer guide says:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">hg</span> <span class="n">clone</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">hg</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">python</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">cpython</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will get output like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">destination</span> <span class="n">directory</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">cpython</span>
<span class="n">requesting</span> <span class="nb">all</span> <span class="n">changes</span>
<span class="n">adding</span> <span class="n">changesets</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you have to wait for a little bit; obviously there has been quite a lot of
changes since Python began in 1989, so this may take ten minutes (depending on
the speed of your computer). There is no progress bar or anything, so you have
to just have faith that something is happening. Eventually, I ended up with
301 M in my new cpython directory.</p>
<p>While that is working, open a new terminal tab and start installing the
dependencies. As the guide points out, the following gives the minimum
required:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">build</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dep</span> <span class="n">python3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Several modules in the standard library depend on optional dependencies, to get
them all you can do this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">libreadline6</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">libsqlite3</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">liblzma</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">libbz2</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">tk8</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">blt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">libgdbm</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">libssl</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span> <span class="n">libncurses5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dev</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Feel free to leave out the ones you know you are not interested in e.g. a
server will not need support for GUIs, so leave out tk8.5-dev and blt-dev in
that case.</p>
<p>A slightly obvious point, but worth pointing out, is that some of these
packages have version numbers in. If your distribution has newer packages than
mine, especially if you are reading this post years after I wrote it, then this
command might give errors. In that case, first try increasing the numbers.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to go back to the developer guide:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">cpython</span>
<span class="o">./</span><span class="n">configure</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="k">with</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">pydebug</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">j2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For completeness, I will just point out that -s is for silent and -j2 allows
make to use two parallel ‘jobs’ which then invoke the compiler i.e. gcc
(for portability reasons make does not use threads or processes but has its own
<a class="reference external" href="http://make.paulandlesley.org/jobserver.html">internal jobserver</a>), you can increase the number 2 but compiling Python is
pretty quick (especially compared to the earlier steps), around half of cpython is actually written in Python anyway.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Even more minimal with CrunchBang Linux</h1>
<img alt="Cruchbang Linux Logo" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/500px-Crunchbang_linux_logo.svg.png"/>
<p>I seem to have become the <a class="reference external" href="http://youtu.be/IzBQnWlWpRY">Littlest Hobo</a> of Linux distributions. I still like
Lubuntu, which is perhaps the best known of half a dozen configured
distribution disk images based on the fast and efficient LXDE.</p>
<p>However, I accidentally selected an option in the login manager of Lubuntu that
made my computer boot into plain Openbox, and I was hooked.</p>
<p>Then in May 2003, I noticed the release announcement of CrunchBang 11 “Waldorf” (which coincided with Debian 7 “Wheezy”) and installed it onto an old machine.</p>
<img alt="Image of a Crunchbang logo with the words decrustification services since 2008" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/crunchbang-decrustification-services.png"/>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://crunchbang.org/">CrunchBang Linux</a>. is even more minimal than Lubuntu, using the Openbox
window manager, like Lubuntu does, however Crunchbang does not put any desktop
environment on top.</p>
<p>I initially just installed it for research purposes, I wanted to learn what an
Openbox distribution looks like when properly configured. I thought I was just
picking up ideas that I would be able to bring back to my Lubuntu computer. (It
turns out that Crunchbang is pretty much the only Openbox distribution.)</p>
<p>The almost completely empty grey screen felt a bit depressing at first but it
subconsciously grew on me; when you have all your applications open, the theme
is a tasteful yet minimalist frame, the OS completely gets out of the way.</p>
<p>The key combination Super and Space (Super is also known as Command on the Apple Mac or the Windows key on Microsoft) brings up the main menu wherever the mouse
cursor is (you can also use right click). This is especially beautiful on
multiple monitors as you do not need to move your focus to the bottom corner of
the left most monitor.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/crunchbang_large.png"><img alt="Image of a two monitor Cruchbang Linux desktop" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/crunchbang_small.png"/></a>
<p>The level of configuration and integration is really quite stunning for such a
small team. However, once up and running, you are basically just running Debian. Apart from a few packages like the themes as so on, everything comes straight
from the Debian stable repositories. Indeed Crunchbang might as well just be
one of the default Debian disk images.</p>
<p>After using some form of Ubuntu or other for the last seven years or so, I was
initially a bit hesitant to install a Debian based system on my desktop.
However, I need not have worried, the difference between Debian and Ubuntu is
rather marginal and certainly far less than my previous jumps from Slackware to Redhat to Gentoo to Ubuntu.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Why Lubuntu?</h1>
<img alt="Lubuntu Logo" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/Lubuntu_logo500.png"/>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://lubuntu.net">Lubuntu</a> is a version of Ubuntu with the LXDE desktop instead of Unity. I am not a Unity hater, I actually like Unity a lot. I just like LXDE more.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> is a desktop focused on performance and keeping out of your way. It is based on GTK+, so in practice it is similar to GNOME or Unity.</p>
<p>I have to admit it is not yet as polished as those other desktop environments, especially the preferences tools are not as consistent and simple as the ones in normal Unity. Since I am the kind of person who ignores the desktop tools anyway and installs my own choice of programs, it doesn’t really matter a great deal.</p>
<p>The LXDE and Lubuntu projects are relatively new and have quite small teams (after all, the more well known GNOME project started in 1997).</p>
<p>If you are interested in writing software for the open source desktop, there seems to be a lot of niches unfilled, a lot more opportunities to make an impact in this kind of project.</p>
<p>I often read articles on the web recommending LXDE for old computers, where is does work much better than more hungrier desktops. Indeed I started using Lubuntu because a computer was struggling with Unity, so I replaced it with Lubuntu and it became a lot more responsive.</p>
<p>However, the same theory applies to new computers too, why waste RAM and processor cycles on stuff you are not even using 99% of the time?</p>
<p>The RAM and processor are there to run the programs I want. The desktop environment, and the operating system in general, should use as little resources as possible.</p>
<p>Currently, Lubuntu has now become the main operating system I use on almost all my computers. I have not tried other LXDE desktops, such as those from Debian or Fedora, I would be very interested in how they compare to Lubuntu.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubuntu on Macbook Pro Retina]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Ubuntu on Macbook Pro Retina</h1>
<p>Yesterday I installed Lubuntu on the Macbook Pro Retina 13 inch. (MacBookPro10,2). I am going to talk about it here. It will be useful for installing normal Ubuntu, or other Linux based distribution on this model of laptop. At the level of hardware support, all flavours of Ubuntu are the same, regardless of the desktop environment.</p>
<p>There are some dire posts on the web saying installing Ubuntu on this machine is impossible. This is not true.</p>
<p>Installing on Macbook Pros are always a bit more involved than PC laptops, partly because Apple is very innovative and always uses the most up to date hardware, it doesn’t seem to care much about compatibility with other hardware or even with its own older products. However, it also does not share its plans or co-operate much, so by the time that the support has got down to the Linux distributions, Apple has completely changed its product line again for the next Christmas.</p>
<p>I found this laptop much easier actually than when my last Macbook Pro come out a couple of years ago, that was a bit of a disaster until support made it into the distributions. I have been using Linux since the late 1990s so I remember some <em>really</em> difficult installs.</p>
<p>Of course it is all relative, it is not as easy as building a desktop of extremely Linux compatible parts (e.g. Intel everything). In that kind of situation, you can put a kettle on, put in the Ubuntu CD and it is finished before you can make a cup of tea. Intel seems to make sure its hardware is supported in Linux before it is released.</p>
<p>If you want that kind of install then, yes, you are out of luck, get a different laptop, maybe one with Linux pre-installed.</p>
<p>Here we are talking more like two hours or so for the install - or longer if you write lots of crap into your blog :)</p>
<p>For this laptop, the main problem is not the install, it is that the desktop environments are not yet geared up for such a high resolution, more on this topic later.</p>
<div class="section" id="usb-boot">
<h2>USB Boot</h2>
<p>The first hurdle is to make a bootable USB stick. This model of Macbook Pro does not have a DVD drive. Therefore, making a bootable USB stick or bootable USB drive is next easiest thing. I tried two different approaches.</p>
<p>The first and simplest approach is to use the usb-creator-gtk application on an existing Linux system. This is a graphical tool that takes an ISO image which you download from the web (e.g. from the <a class="reference external" href="http://lubuntu.net">Lubuntu</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> websites)</p>
<p>The Macbook Pro seemed to be a bit fussy and hard to please regarding which USB sticks it agreed to boot. Best to gather all the ones you own and find one it likes. Before I did my final install, I played about with various distributions on various sticks. I did not notice any particular pattern or reason why some were rejected.</p>
<p>The other approach is to make the bootable USB stick on Mac OS X. This later approach requires a bit more typing but the Mac seems less likely to reject a USB stick it has formatted itself. The Macbook Pro did not refuse to boot any USB sticks using this method, however I did not do a scientific test so it might have just been luck.</p>
<p>Among other things, I tried both Lubuntu 12.10 and the daily build of the forthcoming Lubuntu 13.04. They seemed pretty identical, but it is still a long way until 13.04 is released.</p>
<p>As explained <a class="reference external" href="http://www.warp1337.com/content/install-ubuntu-1210-quantal-quetzal-macbook-pro-101-retina-solved">somewhere on this page</a>, the process started with converting the Lubuntu iso into a disk image. I opened a Terminal on OS X (by clicking on the Finder then Applications then Utilities then Terminal), and then performed conversion using the hdiutil command. In my case:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">hdiutil</span> <span class="n">convert</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">format</span> <span class="n">UDRW</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="n">converted</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ubuntu</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dmg</span> <span class="n">lubuntu</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">12.10</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">desktop</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">amd64</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">mac</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">iso</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then I had to use the Disk Utility to re-partition the USB stick to use the horrid Mac OS Extended format. Once I had done that, I used the dd command to copy the disk image to the USB stick:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">dd</span> <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">ubuntu</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">img</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dmg</span> <span class="n">of</span><span class="o">=/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">disk1</span> <span class="n">bs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="n">m</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That takes quite some time. Check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.warp1337.com/content/install-ubuntu-1210-quantal-quetzal-macbook-pro-101-retina-solved">the article on warp1337 for much fuller instructions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-note-on-mac-os-x-s-toy-file-system">
<h2>A note on Mac OS X’s toy file system</h2>
<p>I don’t know if they have fixed it now, but in my previous experience, I have found that Mac OS X and its Mac OS Extended format does not defragment itself very well, especially compared to ext4. So after you have run OS X for a long time, the partition will be so fragmented that disk utility will refuse to reduce the size of the OS X partition. In this case the only solution is to reformat the partition and reinstall OS X before you try to install Linux.</p>
<p>If you are buying a Mac with the aim of installing Linux, then repartition the drive as soon as you can. If you want to delay installing Linux for some reason then keep it as FAT or some other generic format (you can get Mac OS X applications that give ext support). If you make it a Mac OS X extended format partition then OS X might start storing files there and will then break or moan once you replace the partition with ext4 or whatever.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resize-mac-partitions">
<h2>Resize Mac Partitions</h2>
<p>Now we have to make some space for Linux.</p>
<p>In previous versions of Mac OS X, the utility called “Boot Camp Assistant” would do a lot of the work here, since setting up a partition for Windows would work nicely for Linux too. In OS X 10.8, it wants a Windows DVD to be put in the non-existent DVD drive before it does any work. However, one useful thing Boot Camp Assistant still does is recommend how small you can make the OS X partition, which in my case was 29 GB. So in Boot Camp Assistant, pull the slider around to see what is recommended.</p>
<p>So we need to shrink the Mac OS X partition it and add a new FAT partition, which we will set aside for Linux, this is then reformatted as part of the Linux install. Don’t worry about giving it a swap partition, you can live without it or use a swap file which works just as well.</p>
<p>[Now if like me, you have done it all before in older Macs, be aware. In previous versions, OS X took one partition. Now it actually takes three logical partitions for boot, root and recovery. However, this detail is hidden in the OS X disk utility which only shows one partition, and in the background, re-partitions the root partition and moves the recovery partition along too. I did not realise this and instead of doing the above with the FAT partition, just made free space and let the Ubuntu installer automatically install Linux in it. It kept the first two partitions and gave me Linux root and swap, deleting the recovery partition - frak! Do not make the same mistake, always make sure you have chosen manual partitioning in the installer program - and then double check. If you know how to make OS X put back the OS X recovery partition, please let me know by emailing zeth at the domain name of this site.]</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linux-install">
<h2>Linux Install</h2>
<p>So now all the boring stuff is done, shut down the computer.</p>
<p>If you have the Ethernet dongle, then it is best to plug it in now to an Ethernet connection.</p>
<p>Stick the USB stick in to the USB port and boot to the USB stick by hold down alt (also known as the Option key - but it says Alt on the key!) when you turn it on.</p>
<p>If all goes well, it offers you the choice of Windows! Take that and it will boot the Linux installer from the USB stick.</p>
<p>Choose manual partitioning and delete the FAT partition you made earlier. As said above, don’t worry about swap right now. You can install a swap file later or just forget it. You have 8GB of RAM so hopefully swap will rarely be needed, and a solid state disk does not appreciate it anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refit">
<h2>rEFIt</h2>
<p>Your Linux install finishes, it reboots and ... nothing happens, OS X boots as before without any choice of Linux!</p>
<p>Now you have to install a boot menu. I installed <a class="reference external" href="http://refit.sourceforge.net/">rEFIt</a> as I have done in the past and it worked fine. Then I read that there is the newer <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">rEFInd</a>. I got rid of <a class="reference external" href="http://refit.sourceforge.net/">rEFIt</a> and installed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/">rEFInd</a> and it didn’t seem to work and it was getting boring so I swapped back to rEFIt. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Anyway, now you have three choices on boot: Mac OS X, Linux or some weird emergency prompt.</p>
<p>Choose Linux and Grub boots “in a galaxy far far away”. Yes it is very very small!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-desktop-of-the-lilliputs">
<h2>The desktop of the Lilliputs</h2>
<p>So there has not been a major or minor Ubuntu release since this laptop came out, and unlike some other friendly manufacturers, Apple do not make sure their hardware works with Linux before release (or in fact ever).</p>
<p>However, for now, there is no getting around that this is a very high resolution screen. You have a Linux desktop, but unlike any you have seen before.</p>
<p>There are two ways to work around this high resolution. One is to reduce the resolution in the monitor settings to a lower level, i and it didn’t seem to work and it was getting boring so I swapped back to rEFIt. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>The second approach is to fiddle with the settings of the desktop environment to increase the font size and the size of the title bars and menus etc.</p>
<p>I went through all the Lubuntu Preferences menus changing the default font size from 11 to 20. So now I can at least read everything easily. Some of the icons and things are very undersized but I personally hate any visual evidence of the Operating System anyway. I prefer my whole screen to only show my running application, everything else goes away until I call for it. Most of the stock Lubuntu apps (which are mostly GNOME ones) handle this quite well. So far, the only non-bundled app I have got around to installing is Emacs which copes perfectly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hardware-support">
<h2>Hardware support</h2>
<p>So one of the attractions of this 13-inch model is that it has an Intel graphics card. My old Macbook Pro one had an Nvidia card which needed some proprietary blob and used up the battery much faster than Mac OS X would. The idea was that it would fallback to another chip when on battery, but that feature was not supported when I first installed Linux to it and never got around to looking into it again.</p>
<p>I am not a hardcore gamer, so I always prefer an Intel graphics card over the fiddly proprietary ones. They have a long battery life and tend to just work.</p>
<p>I also prefer a Linux wifi chip but sadly this has some brand new Broadcom chip. So you have to install the wifi driver for it. This is obviously easier if you have the Ethernet dongle we talked about above, if not you will need to download it to a USB stick or something to get it onto the laptop.</p>
<p>Installing the wifi drivers is another few commands. It is explained <a class="reference external" href="http://cberner.com/2012/10/19/installing-ubuntu-12-10-on-macbook-pro-retina/">some way down this page</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://linuxmacbookproretina.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/ubuntu-1304-daily-build-macbook-pro.html">in this page</a>. Hopefully it will be packaged in the future distro releases.</p>
<p>To get the sound card to work correctly, I needed to open the ALSA config file:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">modprobe</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">alsa</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">base</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then I added the following line to the bottom of it:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">options</span> <span class="n">snd</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">hda</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">intel</span> <span class="n">model</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">mbp101</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-things">
<h2>Other things</h2>
<p>That is it really. Only remaining jobs are to remap a key to be middle click and maybe reduce the sensitivity of the trackpad. These are issues of personal taste so I will leave them for now.</p>
<p>This post is a bit rough but I thought it was worth getting it online as soon as possible in case it helps someone.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Samsung Printers on Ubuntu</h1>
<p>After installing the Lubuntu flavour of Ubuntu on most of my machines, I then had to remember how to setup the printer. This is a ‘note to self’ post, hopefully it might be useful to other people.</p>
<p>I don’t print a lot. It it easy and cheap to order family photos online or print them at the local photo shop. But when I do want to print (e.g. boarding pass), I want it to work.</p>
<p>That is why I hate inkjet printers, they are so unreliable and fragile, and the cartridges run out very quickly. So a few years ago I bought a laserjet. They cost a little more but actually work.</p>
<p>I did not want a scanner attached to the top. Scanning is much easier with a separate scanner that you can manipulate into different positions.</p>
<p>I wanted something with only a black cartridge and to be as simple as possible. The extra buttons and features are just gimmicks that nobody really wants (and probably are hard to get going on Linux anyway). I didn’t really care about having wifi or ethernet on the printer since it was expensive back then and, as long as the computer that the usb printer it is plugged into is turned on, Linux computers share usb printers very easily.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Samsung ML-1915" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/samsung_printers_on_ubuntu-samsung_ml_1915.jpg"/>
<p>So I bought the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002P9Q1ZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002P9Q1ZC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=commlinewarr-21">Samsung ML-1915</a> which fitted the bill and love it. Everytime I see a friend or relative struggling with an inkjet I think fondly of my laserjet :) It once got completely covered in building dirt but cleaned up very well. It is has been a loyal piece of kit.</p>
<p>The world moves on and it has been replaced by more modern and cheaper printers like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006W4Z8B4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B006W4Z8B4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=commlinewarr-21">Samsung ML-2165</a>. It does not look quite so cool in white but it is half of the price so who cares.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Samsung ML-2165" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/samsung_printers_on_ubuntu-samsung_ml_2165.jpg"/>
<p>Anyway my printer, like a lot of the Samsung printers, uses the Samsung Unified Linux Driver which for unknown reasons does not seem to be in Ubuntu by default, but it is pretty easy to install it.</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, the Linux driver did come on a CD that came with the printer but it is easier to use the third party repository maintained at the <a class="reference external" href="http://bchemnet.com/">bchemnet.com website</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly you need to edit the sources list to add a repository, so open the file in your favourite editor:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">nano</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sources</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">list</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now add the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">deb</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bchemnet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">suldr</span><span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">debian</span> <span class="n">extra</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we need to add the key for that repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">wget</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">O</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">www</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bchemnet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">suldr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">suldr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gpg</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">key</span> <span class="n">add</span> <span class="o">-</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we need to update the list of packages available:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">update</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we can finally install the driver:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">samsungmfp</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">driver</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It would be much easier if that package was in the standard repositories but there you go. Now you can just add the printer using the normal graphical tool in your system.</p>
<p>In Ubuntu, this is under “System Settings” then “Printing”. In Lubuntu, this is under “System Tools” then “Printers”. Or you can just put system-config-printer into the terminal.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Netbooks in a tablet world</h1>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/31/netbooks-dead-2013">Guardian is ringing the death knell</a> on the netbook. I would tell the story a little differently, so I will.</p>
<img alt="Image of a netbook on bike handlebars" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_bike.jpg"/>
<div class="section" id="in-the-beginning-was-the-100-laptop-dream">
<h2>In the beginning was the $100 laptop dream</h2>
<p>Before 2005, there were not many small factor laptops. I had the smallest Thinkpad, which was merely a smaller version of any other Thinkpad, which had a high end processor and lots of RAM, and it cost quite a bit back then. $1000-2000 dollars was the typical price for a laptop, and due to economies of scale, the then standard 15 inch screen laptop was always the cheapest model, smaller and larger sizes were a bit more expensive.</p>
<p>In 2005, the OLPC (One Laptop Per Child) X1 was announced - a $100 laptop aimed at children, with a special low power processor from AMD, running a version of Fedora Linux, with suitable proportions for a children. The X1 included a video camera, touch screen, sd card slot and wifi; features that were considered high end in 2005.</p>
<img alt="Image the XO laptop for children." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_xo.jpg"/>
<p>The dominant computer companies had a collective nervous breakdown at the mere concept of it. While everyone appreciated the new and noble idea of OLPC, the existing market leaders were extremely hostile to it. Microsoft lobbied departments of education around the world, telling them that if they bought their children non-Microsoft devices then their future careers would be ruined forever, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Intel did something a little more positive in that it dusted off its shoes and worked with hardware manufacturers to get Intel powered devices to the market. The first was ASUS with its educational “Classmate PC”, and the consumer oriented counterpart the Eee PC.</p>
<p>Until this point, the trend of processor manufacturing was towards increasingly more powerful (and hungrier) processors. Intel didn’t even have a suitably efficient chip so it under clocked its lowest laptop processor from 900 MHz to 630 MHz. Later it would get its act together with its Atom chip, but a little late as ARM based chips had already gotten most of the market.</p>
<p>Nobody cared about the Classmate PC, but despite the stupid name, the Eee PC was a big hit. Despite the bizarre 1980s style border around the screen, the early 701 series models were great, they had solid state drives and cost around £200. They were also light enough to use while holding them up, unlike the bulky laptops a lot of people still had back then.</p>
<img alt="Image of the ASUS EEE PC 701" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_asus_eee.jpg"/>
<p>It might not sound it like it now, but in 2007 it seemed really cool that with a netbook, you did not bother with a specialised multi-pocket laptop bag, it was not a chore to throw it into your backpack and keep it with you at all times. If the worst came to the worst and it was lost or stolen, £200 is rather less of a shock than £1000-2000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the OLPC project has had <a class="reference external" href="`http://www.scribd.com/doc/117630420/xmas-card-OLPC-2012">some solid achievements</a>, and 2.5 million kids using the XO laptops, but the initial excitement and the wide coalition of support faded out, and it has not yet managed to overcome the political and monopolistic obstacles to a global roll out. It also never got into the required production volumes to be exactly $100 per unit. If you are a department of education, especially a developing world country, $100 per child is already a lot, a $200 dollar laptop for each child proved to be out of the question. [They always seem to have enough money for military jets and nuclear programmes though!].</p>
<p>This is is a shame because the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_%28desktop_environment%29">Sugar interface</a> is a fantastic learning tool for children. Maybe its time is still to come. They are trying to pull everyone back together for the launch of the new iteration, the XO-4, <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.laptop.org/2012/08/15/one-laptop-per-child-confirms-upcoming-launch-of-groundbreaking-dual-function-xo-4-touch/#post-5016">sometime this year</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="netbooks-and-dodgy-linux-pre-installs">
<h2>Netbooks and dodgy Linux pre-installs</h2>
<p>A lot of other manufacturers brought out ‘netbooks’, we were given an Acer Aspire One by a relative, and some of them, including the Eee PC, came with Linux. What I have never understood about netbooks, is that they always came with an unknown and slightly crap form of Linux, with almost no decent applications on them.</p>
<p>In the wider desktop and laptop markets, Linux users tend to install Linux distributions as an after-market upgrade, sidelining or wiping out completely the redundant copy of Windows install that came pre-installed with the computer. It is an extremely competitive market; at the time of writing this article, the DistroWatch website lists <a class="reference external" href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity">314 currently available Linux distributions</a>.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Fedora 17 desktop" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_fedora-17.png"/>
<p>A lot of these are hobbyist or specialist efforts, but out of this whirlwind come a handful of really big ones, that the majority of Linux users actually have installed. Ignoring distributions aimed at technically proficient users such as Gentoo, Arch, and Slackware, the big ones include Ubuntu, Fedora, SuSE, Debian, Mandriva and Mint.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Linux Mint Desktop" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_mint.png"/>
<p>These are all free, so why didn’t the netbook manufactures install these? They have a proven track record of usability and popularity and existing teams working on improving them. If Ubuntu alone has 20 million users already, then why not sell what these people want? The highly innovative world of Linux, with things constantly forking and splitting, probably does not make it easy for manufacturers, but the big brands like Fedora and Ubuntu are pretty stable participants. Fedora’s backer Redhat had its famous IPO in 1999 and is a S&amp;P 500 company.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Ubuntu on the Dell XPS" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_ubuntu.jpg"/>
<p>I have no idea why laptop manufacturers and the big Linux distributions have not done a better job at working together. Of course, there is obviously a massive obstacle in the entrenched Windows monopoly and the marketing budget that Windows gets from its monopoly profits.</p>
<p>Small companies who pre-install Linux on computers as a boutique service for time-poor Linux users are not readily assisted by the manufacturers of the laptops. Dell had a half-effort at selling Ubuntu laptops, but not in the UK, maybe that will increase. Canonical now seems to be having some new efforts on working with manufacturers with regard to tablets so we will see how that pans out.</p>
<p>In the mean time, what people commonly call “Real Linux” distributions have been completely overtaken by the rise of Android, as we will come to shortly.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-short-reign-of-the-netbook">
<h2>2007-2010 - The short reign of the netbook</h2>
<p>Despite some promising signs, the netbook boom ended pretty quickly. I agree with the Guardian article on that to a certain extent.</p>
<p>As the Guardian points out, the first major blow was specification creep. The computer hardware industry’s habits would not die easily, and they soon watered down the concept. Instead of a small fast portable computer with a web browser, simple fast applications, no moving parts, and costing £200, they soon reverted to type: to make Windows and its accompanying bloatware perform decently required better hardware, regular hard drives replaced solid state storage, whirring fans came back, battery run times collapsed, and they soon crept back up to £300-400.</p>
<img alt="Image of Clippy, the Microsoft Office Assistant" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_clippy.png"/>
<p>Going further than the Guardian article, I would add here that the second and more important blow was a lack of software innovation. Microsoft worked hard to make sure Windows got the lion’s share of pre-installs, but it did not attempt to do anything innovative in the netbook space. It provided either the dated Windows XP (launched in 2001), or a crippled version of its later systems. It did not attempt to create software relevant to a low powered portable device. So the majority of netbooks were sold with software not particularly designed for it.</p>
<p>The third and fatal blow was the launch of the iPad in 2010, and then the arrival of even better Android tablets. A lot of computer users are passive information consumers, and short form and asynchronous interactions of the social networking boom are not inhibited by the lack of a physical keyboard. Unlike netbooks, tablets managed to free themselves from the Windows baggage and have specially tailed operating systems.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Nexus 7" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_nexus7.jpg"/>
<p>Tablets and phones fatally bisect the netbook market; occasional and light users can just use tablets and phones, professionals can afford the $1000 small factor laptops, ‘Ultrabooks™’ as Intel calls them.</p>
<p>However, I think the fact that netbooks were sold with unsuitable Windows operating systems was the biggest factor. I think with the right tailored software, netbooks can be useful tools.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-android-and-chrome">
<h2>The rise of Android and Chrome</h2>
<p>While the “Real Linux” distributions were mostly ignored by the manufacturers. In an act of genius that we almost have come to expect from Google as a matter of routine, it got the concept of commodity computing and used it as a way to increase usage of its own services. Android and Chrome are technically Linux, but all the common applications are replaced by Google’s own offerings, and whatever crap the manufacturer adds on.</p>
<p>Long time Linux users were initially not impressed they could not easily use their existing applications and the fact that it launched with a Java only development environment alienated a lot of C and Python developers on the Linux platform who felt lobotomised by it. Over the last five years, the Linux community has mostly come to terms with Android.</p>
<img alt="Parody image of Android logo eating the Apple logo" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_android.jpg"/>
<p>Android is the most successful distribution in the history of open source software. Don’t get me wrong, I like it a lot, I have Android devices and I love them in their own way, but it is not want I really want for my primary computing device. This would take another whole article to explain but Android is Linux but with all the joie de vivre, the joy and enthusiasm, sucked out of it. Also, I still it is relatively early days in open source software, the big game changing Linux device has not been invented yet.</p>
<img alt="Image of Tux, the Linux mascot inside the Android logo." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_tux_inside.png"/>
<p>Here is where I have to really depart from the Guardian article, they claim that no netbooks are being released. Well I think that must be a pretty narrow definition of a netbook.</p>
<p>Chromebooks, netbooks with Google stuff preinstalled rather than Microsoft’s, are the second incarnation of netbooks. Because Chromebooks use a special BIOS and bootloader, it is currently a bit of a faff installing your own Linux distribution, but <a class="reference external" href="http://chromeos-cr48.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/chrubuntu-1204-now-with-double-bits.html">it is possible</a> and hopefully it will get easier over time if the distros find some easier way of installing on Chromebooks.</p>
<p>So from the perspective of a Linux user, despite the initial faff, Ubuntu on an Acer Chromebook is little different than running Ubuntu on an Acer Aspire. For me Chromebooks are still netbooks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="netbooks-will-not-die">
<h2>Netbooks will not die</h2>
<p>For me the netbook format is still relevant and will not die (yet at least).</p>
<p>Tablets are like small babies, you have to hold them all the time, I haven’t mastered the art of propping the iPad up. Even bespoke stands are never around the moment you want to put the tablet down. Giving a presentation from a tablet or a phone not only requires being very organised - it is hard to make last minute changes from a tablet, it is also quite expensive to get a VGA connector for them (and you have to not lose it).</p>
<img alt="Image of a bluetooth keyboard" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_keyboard.jpg"/>
<p>I know it is not trendy, but sometimes you just want to use physical keys. I do have a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004UJORTC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=commlinewarr-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004UJORTC">very nice bluetooth keyboard</a> for my Android powered Samsung S3, but Emacs does not work very well on it, it is not ported very well and Android’s own features try to take over. Although I will hopefully get over some of these problems over time.</p>
<img alt="Image of an exploaded desktop case" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_desktop.png"/>
<p>At the moment I am very lucky to have a high end laptop due to the nature of my job. However in general, I am a desktop type of guy. I like buying the components and screwing them together. I like being able to stick more RAM in later when it becomes cheaper. I like being able to scavenge for spare parts and turning three broken machines into two working ones. I like two full sized monitors.</p>
<img alt="Image of an desktop case with cd tray showing" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_desktop2.jpg"/>
<p>I hate it when expensive laptops break, in general these are not fixable at home and have to be sent away, which can be as expensive as a netbook, but is also inconvenient being without it for several weeks.</p>
<p>For me a netbook is a very nice complement to the desktop/home media server type setup. It works enough offline, and with a good connection I can use the full power of my home desktop remotely. If it breaks it is less of a problem, being £200 to replace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chromebooks">
<h2>Chromebooks</h2>
<p>Lets have a look at some Chromebooks.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Acer C7" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_acer.jpg"/>
<p>The cheapest current Chromebook seems to be the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009VHRMOU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=commlinewarr-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B009VHRMOU">Acer C7 Chromebook</a> which at $200 and £200 is a pretty unfair currency conversion, it certainly one to buy while in the US, or perhaps have posted from a US seller if you are not in a hurry. I like the fact it has VGA (for projectors) and HDMI (for TVs) and still has an ethernet port (for plugging into a wired network) which is rare this days. It is not lacking in power with an over-generous 2GB of RAM. It has a massive 320GB old fashioned hard drive, which you will either love (lots of storage and less fear of disk corruption) or hate (it is a moving part which can make noise and potentially fail). I personally would prefer a small solid state drive.</p>
<p>If you get through the Chromebook bootloader hassle and successfully get Linux installed, since it has an Intel processor and graphics, it should work pretty well. Intel graphics is a plus since Intel stuff normally works automatically without the need for a proprietary driver (but then I am not a gamer, Linux gamer types always seem to get Nvidia graphics). It does not say what the wifi chip is, if it is Intel too then all the better.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Samsung Chromebook" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_samsung.jpg"/>
<p>More expensive, but at least with a sane UK price, at $325 or £230 is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009RF0AQ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=commlinewarr-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B009RF0AQ8">Samsung Chromebook</a>. It also has 2GB of RAM but it is slim and fanless with a 16GB solid state drive and bluetooth.</p>
<p>So in many ways it is a better machine than the Acer but it is ARM, which is the trendy thing but there is no support for hardware accelerated graphics at the moment for Linux on this ARM chip and some proprietary software might not work either if it does not have an ARM binary, if you rely on Skype or Flash or something, you might want to check if these work on ARM. However, Michael Larabel of Phoronix has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=samsung_chrome_a15&amp;num=1#phxcms_content_center">reported good things about it</a>.</p>
<p>Both seem nice but neither are the perfect netbook.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="less-is-more">
<h2>Less is more</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, I think these are still too high expensive and in that sense, netbooks have not really begun yet.</p>
<img alt="Image of a coloured Asus netbooks" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_colour.jpg"/>
<p>Of course when compiling software or doing video editing or whatever, one still wants the best computer possible. However, If I was designing a netbook, I would accept that in 2013, you are likely to have many computing devices - phones, tablets, smart TVs, desktops and games consoles and so on. I would explicitly make it good at being a cheap portable laptop you sling in your backpack.</p>
<p>The ‘Zethbook’ would be a small factor laptop with modest (32GB or 64GB) solid state drive and preferably no fans or other moving parts, with no more than 1.0 GHz processor, and no more than 1GB of RAM, preferably with Intel graphics or some other Linux supported chipset.</p>
<p>The Zethbook could then be incrementally improved in other ways that do not involve unnecessary bloating up the cost and power usage, as battery technology improves but the processor stays the same, why not 100 hours of usage? Why not 1000 hours? Make it sandproof for the beach, make it waterproof so you spill a whole glass of soda over it or use it in the shower. Make the keyboard better, improve the screen resolution, make it more user modifiable. Improve the shock resistance so it can cope with being accidentally dropped open with the screen hitting the floor first, let it be bike proof and fall off the handlebars at 20 mph and hit the road without damage. Let it fall out of a car window at 60 mph.</p>
<img alt="Image of a netbook at the beach" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_beach.jpg"/>
<p>It is great that computers get more powerful every year, but I think it is a bit too one-sided. The international Space Station runs on the 386 processor which was brought out in 1985. The Linux kernel and GNU GCC compiler are now starting to remove support for it now, but the 386 is still (in theory) usable with Linux for a while longer. Going forward in time, with an efficient choice of operating system, 95% of things can be done on a Pentium 4 computer from 2000. It is just lazy programming that requires bloated systems all the time.</p>
<img alt="Image of the OpenPandora" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_openpandora.png"/>
<p>Sadly you won’t see the Zethbook any time soon. Boards aside, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openpandora.org/">OpenPandora</a> (warning: linked web page has sound) is the nicest complete Linux device I have seen so far, it is a handheld game console costing over $500. It is not that easy to get the price down without being made by the biggest manufacturers like Asus, Acer or Samsung etc.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Raspberry Pi" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/netbooks_in_a_tablet_world_rpi.jpg"/>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Model B is perfectly usable at 512 MB and 700 Mhz (twice as powerful as the original version of the OLPC XO). The Raspberry Pi Model B is $35. Granted it does not have a keyboard (cheap) or a screen (expensive) or wifi, but we can still imagine a portable device for $100, which of course, is the OLPC dream that started the netbook story. I am quite interested in those who are putting the Raspberry Pi in home made mobile forms and may follow that up in a future post.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts on netbooks. Do you love or hate the netbook. Will you miss its passing if it does die out? Do you like or hate the idea of Chromebooks?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Zoneminder on Ubuntu</h1>
<p>Ever thought about building your own CCTV system? All you need is free and open source software Zoneminder, a free Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, Lubuntu or Debian, an old PC and a camera.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-zoneminder">
<h2>What is Zoneminder?</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.zoneminder.com/">Zoneminder</a> is an open source application used for CCTV and other security and surveillance applications. You can use it to monitor your home or work property or to monitor your pets while you are out, whatever you can imagine really (look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zoneminder.com/screenshots">screenshots on the Zoneminder homepage</a> for more ideas).</p>
<p>The implementation is basically a Perl/PHP web app using Apache and MySQL (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> as we call it in the trade). If you have ever set up a website or blog or something then you will understand it instantly. It is a nice concept as using <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_nothing">shared nothing</a> web application and system administration principles it can scale up indefinitely to very large commercial uses.</p>
<p>If you are the kind of person who already has a home wifi or wired network and a home server or desktop on all the time, then Zoneminder will fit in great, as the only extra electricity you will be using will be the camera (or cameras) themselves.</p>
<p>Zoneminder is really flexible and configurable, which is fantastic but also means that you do have to configure it for your own needs. If you have quite a minimalist IT setup at home with no machines running most of the time (e.g. just a iPad in your Thames-side studio apartment), then using Zoneminder at home might be overkill, as you can probably buy a pre-made embedded home CCTV system that runs off a single plug and does not require configuration.</p>
<p>Zoneminder stores the recorded video as single frame images in a simple data layout on your filesystem and the web application allows you to configure it and view the cameras in real time and view recorded footage. The metadata is stored in the MySQL database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-kind-of-camera-do-i-need">
<h2>What kind of camera do I need?</h2>
<p>It seems you can use anything. If you have a simple USB webcam lying around at home, that is all you need to get started. If then you like Zoneminder you can then get a posher camera later if you want.</p>
<p>There different types of cameras depending on how serious you are. The more serious people put a card in their computer (such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000075ANQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=commlinewarr-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000075ANQ">Hauppauge Impact VCB/PCI Composite AV Input card</a> ) and use real high definition video cameras.</p>
<p>I personally use a ‘netcam’ (I have the model called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004UBSHQO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=commlinewarr-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004UBSHQO">TRENDnet SecurView Wireless N Internet Camera</a> if you want to be precise) which is basically a webcam with a built in wireless card (and or ethernet socket). So you can put the camera anywhere you can power it and it will log onto your wireless network like any other device. You don’t have to run AV cables back to your computer.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>[The same advice that I always give concerning routers and other network devices applies here: if you buy such a netcam, check its website for any firmware updates, especially security updates, before you add the device to your network. These things are little network connected computers after all, containing a proprietary operating system. This system may have been written by a guy with a masters in network security from MIT, or it could have been written by a subcontractor earning £1 per hour in who knows where. The problem with all proprietary software is that there is no public peer review (unlike with open source software). So check the vendor for security updates.]</div></blockquote>
<p>If a burglar manages to get in and picks up the netcam, there are no wires to follow back and so no clue as to where the images go. One can also use backup software or write a few bash scripts to copy images to a remote server or the cloud if you are in a high crime area. If you have a really good internet connection at both ends, you can put netcams in your relatives’ houses and allow your Zoneminder server to grab the images off.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-kind-of-server-do-i-need">
<h2>What kind of server do I need?</h2>
<p>By ‘server’ in the article, I just mean the computer that will have Zoneminder installed, as opposed to any other computers, tablets, phones or even TVs you might use to operate the system on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>I suppose (in theory) you could use any operating system that can run Perl, Apache and Mysql. However, the assumption from here is that you will be using a Linux distribution, because Windows and OS X are, to put it bluntly, completely crap in this server role and a massive hassle to work with. If you have a Linux Desktop already at home, then that will probably work fine.</p>
<p>In my experience, the server does not need to particularly powerful for a simple home setup. I am using a low-powered PC from 2006 which runs Zoneminder and lots of other apps quite nicely.</p>
<p>You don’t have to have a graphical system, you can use something like Ubuntu Server if you want. However, you will need some computer or phone with a web browser to control Zoneminder and view the saved images/video, this does not have to be a Linux computer (toy operating systems work fine as clients).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-vs-packages">
<h2>Source vs Packages</h2>
<p>A couple of years ago I installed Zoneminder on Ubuntu 11.04 by downloading the source. Now over Christmas I had a spare 20 mins and re-installed the OS. I like backing up and reinstalling occasionally as it gives a nice clean system. This time I went for Ubuntu 12.10 in the Lubuntu flavour (I will talk about that in the future). Then I had to put all the data and programs back on.</p>
<p>Last time I installed Zoneminder from source, this time I thought I would try the Ubuntu packages. This guide should work for any Ubuntu or Debian type system, but your mileage may vary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lets-get-started">
<h2>Lets get started.</h2>
<p>Firstly, we need to install the zoneminder package, you can do this in the graphical “software centre” or you can just open a terminal and use this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">zoneminder</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On a fresh system without Mysql, it will ask you to set a Mysql root password. Next it configures the nullmailer mail relay, I just accepted the default answers. Then it stops returns control of the shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="apache-settings">
<h2>Apache settings</h2>
<p>Now we need to let Apache know what is going on. If you are already using Apache to show websites on this system, you can integrate Zoneminder in a way that does not clash with your other sites.</p>
<p>However, on a fresh system, you can do this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">ln</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">zm</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">apache</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">apache2</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">conf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">zoneminder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span>
<span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">apache2</span> <span class="n">reload</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now when you go in your web browser to <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/zm/">http://localhost/zm/</a> you can now see the console.</p>
<img alt="Image of the Zoneminder console in a web browser" src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-1console.png"/>
<p>If you have installed Zoneminder to a non-graphical server distribution, then obviously use the IP address or domain name instead of localhost when you access Zoneminder from your external computer or phone or whatever.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="camera-setup">
<h2>Camera Setup</h2>
<p>When you click on Add New Monitor, you get a web form that looks like this:</p>
<img alt="Image of the Add New Monitor web form in a web browser." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-2addmonitor.png"/>
<p>The most important field here is “source type”, the setting chosen affects the options available in the source tab (see below). Since I am using a netcam, I set it to remote.</p>
<p>Another important field is ‘Function’. Modect is short for ‘motion detect’, it records when there is motion, other options include constantly recording and just monitoring without recording.</p>
<p>Now we come onto the source tab, as shown below:</p>
<img alt="Image of the define source form in a web browser." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-3definesource.png"/>
<p>This window allows you to define the hostname of your camera. So for a netcam we give it the host name of the camera, which in a home setup will probably be a private ip address (e.g. 192.168.x.x). Look up your camera on the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zoneminder.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_hardware">Supported hardware section of the Zoneminder wiki</a>  to find what settings you need to add here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="log-driven-configuration">
<h2>Log driven configuration</h2>
<p>You can read the Zoneminder ‘system log’ by clicking on a link unsurprisingly called ‘log’ (as shown in the main console screenshot above). This gives as a log viewer, as shown below:</p>
<img alt="Image of the log viewer in a web browser." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-4log.png"/>
<p>The way I configure Zoneminder is by reading the activity log and keep changing configuration until it stops moaning.</p>
<p>So I started with this error:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">Can</span><span class="s1">'t open memory map file /dev/shm/zm.mmap.1, probably not enough space free: Permission denied</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This due to the default settings of Ubuntu (or Lubuntu in my case). There is a kernel setting called shmmax which determines the maximum size of a shared memory segment i.e. the total amount of RAM that can be used when Zoneminder is grabbing images from the video driver.</p>
<p>[You may vaguely remember doing this before because some ‘enterprise’ (i.e. bloated) databases and other business software often requires this too.]</p>
<p>So on my fresh install, shmmax was set to 32MB by default and it needed to be more than 96MB, so I increased it to 128MB to be sure.</p>
<p>How much you need depends on how posh your camera is. The higher resolution the camera, the more RAM Zoneminder will need to use.</p>
<p>A quick hack way is to just override the number in /proc, obviously this only works on the live system, when you reboot the setting is gone. However, it is a quick way to play about with the setting:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">su</span>
<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="mi">536870912</span> <span class="o">&gt;/</span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">kernel</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">shmmax</span>
<span class="n">exit</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can work the setting by trial and error but you can also just to look in the Zonemaster wiki, or to google it, as it is likely that someone else is already using Zonemaster with the same model of camera you have.</p>
<p>I restarted zonemaster:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">zonemaster</span> <span class="n">restart</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And it solved the problem. So because I then knew it worked, (as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zoneminder.com/wiki/index.php/FAQ#What_does_a_.27Can.27t_shmget:_Invalid_argument.27_error_in_my_logs_mean.3F_and_my_cameras_won.27t_display_video_at_higher_resolutions.">advised by Zonemaster wiki</a>), I made a config file to do this on boot:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">su</span>
<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="n">kernel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shmmax</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">536870912</span> <span class="o">&gt;/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">sysctl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">kernel</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">shm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span>
<span class="n">sysctl</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">p</span>
<span class="n">exit</span>

<p>Next up in the log was the error:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">waiting</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">capture</span> <span class="n">daemon</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is fixed by adding the web server user to the video group:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">adduser</span> <span class="n">www</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="n">video</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(Why isn’t this sorted out by the .deb package? And why is it not given its own user?)</p>
<p>Just keep attacking the log errors until it is all happy really.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuring-image-location">
<h2>Configuring Image Location</h2>
<p>By default the images are bunged into: /usr/share/zoneminder/events which is a symbolic link to /var/cache/zoneminder/events/1/</p>
<p>In theory, to change this you need to change the setting ZM_DIR_EVENTS which is the first setting under ‘Options’ then ‘Paths’. Use an absolute path and make sure the destination has the correct permissions.</p>
<p>In reality, I never had much luck changing this. When it tries to read the events back, it seems to be somehow hardcoded to the old location which is then appends with this location. If anyone has the answer to this let me know.</p>
<p>So instead I have had more luck just ignoring this configuration option and instead myself replacing the symbolic link /usr/share/zoneminder/events with my own:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">rm</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">share</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">zoneminder</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">events</span>
<span class="n">ln</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">my_better_location</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">share</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">zoneminder</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">events</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By default there is no lockdown on the web interface, so if the machine is web accessible, you will want to change that (options &gt; OPT_USE_AUTH). When you first turn on authentication, the username is admin and password is admin. You will probably want to change that too! (Options &gt; Users - only appears when authentication is turned on).</p>
<p>There are lots of other things you can configure like the sensitivity of the motion detection and which regions of the image to watch and which to ignore it etc. However, we have covered everything specific to using Zoneminder on an Ubuntu/Debian system using the .deb packages. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zoneminder.com/wiki/index.php/">Zoneminder wiki</a> is very useful and comprehensive so dig around there to find out more.</p>

<h2>Zoneminder in action</h2>
<p>Now if you have read this far you deserve to have some silly pictures.</p>
<p>Having a CCTV camera at the front of your house educates you a lot about what happens in your local community. I have learned all sorts of things from watching back footage at random. Most of the cool snaps I probably cannot post online for legal and taste reasons.</p>
<p>The first revelation is that a large amount of people look through your windows. Here is a fairly tame and blurry one.</p>
<img alt="Image of someone looking into the camera." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-5everybodystares.jpg"/>
<p>I have had people come right up to the camera and look through the windows. One person even wrote down details in a pad.</p>
<p>Where does the box load of paper spam come from? Well Zoneminder will tell you. Here is a guy promoting a pizza company:</p>
<img alt="Image of someone giving me a pizza advert." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-6pizzaad.jpg"/>
<p>Here is a free ‘newspaper’ full of ads:</p>
<img alt="Image of someone giving me free newspaper." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-7freeadpaper.jpg"/>
<p>Fortunately, we still have real postmen. But they seem to be far more informally dressed than Postman Pat:</p>
<img alt="Image of someone giving me free newspaper." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-8realpostman.jpg"/>
<p>I think he was a special temp over Christmas. Sadly they all seem to have these granny trolleys now instead of the cool Pashley bicycles they used to have.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the dustmen come and take all this rubbish away, even in heavy rain:</p>
<img alt="Image of bin men and a dust cart." src="https://www.zeth.net/_images/zoneminder_on_ubuntu-9binmen.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="section" id="over-to-you">
<h2>Over to you</h2>
<p>So setting up Zoneminder takes a little fiddling but it is good fun and reassuring to have the ability to look back in time at what was happening in front of your house in the past. If you have a go or have tried Zoneminder before, please let everyone know how you got on and how I could improve this guide. Bonus points for silly pictures.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>You can’t stop the signal</h1>
<p>When I started this site in 2005, I said that my blog was:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“about taking control of your own technology, it looks at our experiences of computing; especially computing using GNU/Linux, often using the command line and other textual means, but also other issues such as ethics, best practices and whatever is cool now.”</div></blockquote>
<p>In 2007, in <a class="reference external" href="http://zeth.net/archive/2007/07/26/command-line-warriors/#post-483">answer to a question</a>, I provided this further description:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“The broader meaning is someone who is willing to take the extra time and effort to think through and take control of all the technology that is entering into our daily lives; to make sure that our freedoms, hard-fought for on the battle field, protest rally and ballot box, are not quietly surrendered in the digital age, but instead freedom must be at the very foundation of technology itself.”</div></blockquote>
<p>About a year ago (December 2011), I decided to take some time off writing here. I thought that if I stopped writing blog posts and stopped writing mailing list posts and stopped Tweeting it would give me more time and energy to make progress in other areas of my life.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>By not engaging with the interests and interested communities that got me where I am philosophically and technically, my passion started to fade and I lost those key insights that only come from interacting with others in the field.</p>
<p>So I have decided to try to restart writing. All <a class="reference external" href="http://zeth.net/archive/posts/">previous entries from 2005 to 2011 are now archived</a>, and I have a clean new chapter to begin.</p>
<p>Bear with me as I build up confidence again as a writer. The biggest difficulty I have is writing to a silent audience. It is difficult to know which topics to address if I do not know the audience’s interests. So please do give me your comments and ideas. There is a comment box available below and my twitter name is <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0">zeth0</a>.</p>
