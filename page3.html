            <h1><a href="2016/05/17/pirate_gamepad.html">The Case of the Pirate Gamepad</a></h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/pirategamepad.jpg" src="_images/pirategamepad.jpg"/>
<p>I made some software (which will be explained in a future post) and
used my trusty Argos third-party PS3 style gamepad to control it.</p>
<p>On the way to open sourcing it, I thought I had better try it with a
an official Sony PS3 gamepad, and I could always do with another
gamepad for when playing computer with the sprog.</p>
<p>We play a lot of open source games like SuperTuxKart and Frogatto
which are two of our favourites. To be honest we play almost every
game made available through Debian’s Apt.</p>
<p>So not really thinking too heavily about it, I popped onto a leading
auction website, typed in PS3 gamepad, saw that the first result cost
less than £13 including postage, and just bought it and moved
on. Total time spent was about a minute.</p>
<p>Later I thought it was a bit cheap but ignored the thought on the
basis that the PS3 is ten years old and has been long replaced by the
PS4. The controller that game was the one above. In the following box.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/piratebox.jpg" src="_images/piratebox.jpg"/>
<p>Initial impressions were that it was a little light and the D-pad was
different than I remember. However, it is probably been 5 years since
I touched an official PS3 gamepad and maybe they made production
improvements to make it lighter or I didn’t really remember right.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I plugged it in, and typed <cite>dmesg</cite>, the controller
itself confessed to its real identity.:</p>

<p>The controller was totally fake!</p>
<p>So it didn’t help me generalise my software. Also these controllers
contain a Lithium battery so I am not comfortable putting this
counterfeit device in my child’s hands. If they are so far beyond the
legal system that they do not need to care about the trademarks of
Sony, how much do they care about electrical safety? Or chemical
safety?</p>
<p>So I emailed my findings to the seller and they gave me an immediate
refund and didn’t need to send the controller back. A counterfeiter
with great customer service! Bizarre.</p>
<p>It is amazing the level of detail they went to. It is itself an
interesting cultural artefact; a Chinese made plastic product
pretending to be a different Chinese made plastic product. It is
interesting philosophical discussion about if you use the same design,
make it in the same place and maybe even use the exact same parts,
what does genuine actually mean?</p>
<p>And what the heck is the markup on the official Sony controller if
another company can make an almost exact replica for a less than a
third of the price?</p>
<p>It is shame that people feel the need to be dishonest. A third party
PS3 controller does not need to hide its true nature. I love my Argos
one which has some useful extra features.</p>
<p>Surely selling the controller as what it is would be simpler than
having to sneak around and recreate accounts constantly on the auction
site?</p>
<p>If the manufacturer had said, “this is a PS3 compatible gamepad and it
is three times cheaper”, then it could find its own market. While you
are at it, put in a higher capacity battery and better bluetooth
aerial than Sony’s controller and win on both price and quality.</p>
<p>As for me, I bought an official wired Xbox 360 controller from
Argos. I actually prefer the shape ergonomically and it is more
reliably detected by Linux and is much cheaper than the PS3 gamepad.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/office.jpg" src="_images/office.jpg"/>
<p>This has been a very exciting year. I burst out of the academy and
started a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.infomachine.uk/">new company</a> with a couple of other chaps called Rob and
Luke.</p>
<p>The idea is write a platform to help generate form-based applications,
which could absorb and display business data. We could then in the
future add machine learning/artificial intelligence type features, and
learn original ideas that have not been apparent without such
statistical modelling.</p>
<p>Basically we are trying to make Skynet, the singularity itself, which
we call Infomachine. Of course, being a start-up, it might evolve into
a different concept involving washing machines or something.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/infomachine.png" src="_images/infomachine.png"/>
<p>Meanwhile, some customers found their way to us and we have been doing
lots of consulting and contract software development. The customers
themselves are highly intelligent and beautiful people who have
extensive domain knowledge in their own field, and it has been very
interesting learning some of this as we write software to make their
companies more efficient or expand into new areas.</p>
<p>This all feeds back into the eventual completion of the Infomachine,
or not; maybe we will go in a completely different direction, that is
the fun part, there are just three of us in a (often virtual) room and
we can do whatever the heck we like.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/dancer.jpg" src="_images/dancer.jpg"/>
<p>In this post I thought about the world of cool that lies between
high-level languages and C. Thought is too strong, it is more of a
seed of a thought that has not germinated yet. This is not a fable
with a moral at the end.</p>
<p>When I first came across C#, I thought that is much better than Visual
Basic, perhaps Microsoft’s .Net platform could be interesting one day,
but not personally having an obvious project to use it in, I put it to
one side and have never touched it since.</p>
<p>When Vala was first announced, I thought wow, that is so sexy and I
played with it for about a week. Not personally having an obvious
project to use it in, I put it to one side and have never touched it
since.</p>
<p>I had pretty much the same reaction to Go (aka golang) - wow that’s
cool, perhaps not as sexy as Vala but I like the goroutines. I did the
trendy web based tour, I installed everything locally and played with
the standard library. Then, not personally having an obvious project
to use it in, I put it to one side and have never touched it since.</p>
<p>I could go on and on. Whatever piece of tech that comes into (or back
into) fashion seems to follow this pattern, Haskell, Erlang, Java,
Scala, etc etc. A lot of the developer tools industry and technology
media needs something shiny and new to promote this year.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love all this stuff, I would love to do projects
in different programming languages but obviously, as I have a
reputation for writing Python or JavaScript or doing system
administration, people hire me to do that and don’t perhaps think of
me for other things.</p>
<p>Maybe there is more too it than that, since in whatever I am doing, in
my head I seem to think of any algorithm in Python first as executable
pseudocode even if it gets typed in using JavaScript or another
language.</p>
<p>I had a long stint as an academic, but basically my whole career in
software is as a freelancer or contractor. A journeyman who works to
live.</p>
<p>Often the customer has an existing project or specific library,
toolkit or team which pre-determines the choice of programming
language.</p>
<p>Otherwise, my usual process for creating software is to prototype it
in a high level language (normally always Python but sometimes
JavaScript). 90% of the time, once it works the customer has solved
their immediate problem and wants to move their focus onto their next
problem, which may not be software and may not involve paying
freelance programmers. Sad I know, thanks for all the fish, I am here,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XGX98OW4Rc">like the song says</a>, etc etc :)</p>
<p>When the prototype is working, there is a lot to be done to optimise
it and keep it as a Python application, and almost always there is
some specific other bottleneck (such as network, database or some
industrial requirement) that means that CPU usage is not the problem
and so cutting out the Python interpreter wouldn’t actually make much
difference in the short and medium time-frames that most companies
care about.</p>
<p>Indeed I have seen cases where the customer has gotten someone to
rewrite the prototype application in Java, and found that the new
version is actually slower. A lot of the heavy duty work in the Python
version was actually happening inside a C library that has been highly
optimised over the last 30 years; changing the dependency from that to
a poorly implemented Java library caused the poor performance.</p>
<p>If we imagine a Python application is like a commissioning a
photograph, a C app is commissioning a sculpture. You only do it when
you want something to really last or really be the core of something
fundamental for your future success.</p>
<p>All the above notwithstanding, the genius of Python’s initial design
is that once your application has taken a stable(ish) form, it is
normally pretty straightforward to convert the application to C.</p>
<p>Most of the standard library inherits Linux/Unix best practice (and
even the same function names) and a lot of the best external libraries
in Python are just wrappers around the C equivalents. You always have
the fully working Python application to test it against.</p>
<p>It takes a long time yes, going through line by line, but you are not
troubling the boundaries of computer science or software engineering
as we know it. I actually love those kind of cathartic jobs, but I am
a freak.</p>
<p>Apologies if I am stating the bleeding obvious, none of the above text
is news to anyone, any Python developer knows the same thing, however
it is the foundation for what follows.</p>
<p>So the real reason why I have not personally had an obvious project to
use a lot of these fashionable and ‘cool’ languages and toolkits is
that they fall in the luke-warm middle ground between the extremely
high-level Python (and JS/Ruby/LISP etc) and the low level C language.</p>
<p>For most use cases, all these middle ground languages are slower and
less portable than C. If you have decided on a re-implementation, then
it takes no longer to rewrite a Python project to C than to Go, Java,
C# or whatever, indeed it might often be quicker to C.</p>
<p>I have actually used C hardly at all, far less than I would like to
have done, but I have used these middle-ground languages even
less. Everything just stays in high level code.</p>
<p>So as I warned, I have no moral for this fable, no conclusion to
offer, it is just the beginnings of a thought that ran through my
brain, I like to think I will pick up this theme later, but I will
probably look back in five years to find I have put it to one side and
have never touched it since.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/phonecall.jpg" src="_images/phonecall.jpg"/>
<p>This post is about BBDB (Big Brother Database), which is the main
contacts application available for Emacs.</p>
<div class="section" id="contacts-application-for-emacs">
<h2>Contacts Application for Emacs</h2>
<p>BBDB is packaged within distributions, albeit quite old versions of it
are packaged within Debian at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Information about BBDB can be found at its <a class="reference external" href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/">Savannah homepage</a>, and
most importantly <a class="reference external" href="http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bbdb/">downloads are found here</a>. I wanted the latest
version so I downloaded it from there.</p>
<p>The latest versions (that begin with 3, e.g. 3.1.2) require Emacs 23
or 24, an older version of Emacs will require version 2 of BBDB;
although it is much nicer for other reasons to use the latest version
of Emacs that you can get.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bbdb.git/plain/README">README</a> gives full instructions to get set up. Basically, like
with most other Emacs libraries, you make the library available by
editing the ~/.emacs file and using the require function.</p>
<div class="highlight-scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">require</span> <span class="ss">'bbdb-loaddefs</span> <span class="s">"/path/to/bbdb/lisp/bbdb-loaddefs.el"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-format">
<h2>Storage Format</h2>
<p>Despite the name ending in DB, contacts are stored in a plain text
file at ~/emacs.d/bbdb (where ~ represents the user’s home directory).</p>
<p>It is worth knowing that each line in the file is a contact, which
takes the form of a vector, this is a LISP data type similar to a
JavaScript Array or Python list (but items are delimited with spaces
rather than commas).</p>
<p>If you ever edit the file by hand or with code you write yourself, it
is important to keep one item to a line, if a line break gets removed
then BBDB will reject the file until you fix it.</p>
<p>Since it is a plain text file, you can do back it up easily, sync it
between computers, write scripts that do things to it, track it with
git or whatever you can imagine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="importing-contacts">
<h2>Importing Contacts</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/adam.jpg" src="_images/adam.jpg"/>
<p>If you already have a load of contacts somewhere, then the best way to
get started is to import them from there. I personally had a load of
contacts in Google Contacts that had been built up from my Gmail
account and Android phone.</p>
<p>I used a lovely little Python script called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deong/charrington">charrington</a> which grabbed
all the contacts from Google and added them to a bbdb file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-bbdb">
<h2>Using BBDB</h2>
<p>As always, M is for Meta which means Alt on an IBM-PC style keyboard.</p>
<p>Typing M-x bbdb allows you to search for a contact. So if I search for
Elizabeth, I get this contact:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/bbdb.png" src="_images/bbdb.png"/>
<p>The other commands all start with bbdb- for example, M-x bbdb-create
allows you to type in a new record. There is almost a hundred
commands, but you do not need to remember them. Using tab completion
shows them all, they are also organised in a toolbar menu.</p>
<p>If you have imported lots of contacts from Google Contacts, then
sometimes different pieces of information about a person are stored
under different names.</p>
<p>One of the most useful things is M-x bbdb-search-duplicates, this
allows you to merge contacts together and/or delete duplicate contacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-mail">
<h2>Sending Mail</h2>
<p>When you have point over a record, pressing m will allow you to
compose an email to the person. Emacs then drops you into message mode.</p>
<p>Email in Emacs is another topic entirely, but if you put the following
into your ~/.emacs file then you have setup the absolute basics:</p>
<div class="highlight-scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">user-mail-address</span> <span class="s">"youremail@example.com"</span>
    <span class="nv">user-full-name</span> <span class="s">"Your Name"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have a mail transport agent or relay (such as mstmp) setup then
Emacs can pass the email to whatever is pointed to by
/usr/sbin/sendmail or you can use Emacs <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/smtpmail/Emacs-Speaks-SMTP.html">itself to relay email</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-features">
<h2>Other features</h2>
<p>Pressing simply e edits the current line. ; allows you to write an
attached note. If the record has a www field then W displays the web
page.</p>
<p>You can even phone your contacts directly from Emacs! Typing M-d will
phone the current contact; obviously you need to have a modem or some
other kind of phone system setup.</p>
<p>Various mail and news packages for Emacs can make use of your contacts
to provide auto-fill functions, e.g. in the To: field of an email.</p>

<p>msmtp is yet another Mail Transfer Agent that merely relays the
outgoing email message to another (e.g. your ISP’s) SMTP server. There
seems to be quite a lot of these, but this one seems to be the most
actively maintained - <a class="reference external" href="http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/">see its homepage on sourceforge</a> for more
information and documentation. At time of writing, the last stable
release is March 9, 2014 which is very recent.</p>
<p>Other similar ones, such as ssmtp, esmtp and nbsmtp, still seem to
work, they are pretty simple programs with few dependencies apart from
the C environment which basically never changes anymore and they are
recompiled and repackaged regularly by the distributions.</p>
<p>I have a machine running on Debian stable but wanted a newer version
of msmtp than is packaged for stable. So I cloned the source code
using git and compiled it.</p>
<p>However, after removing the default mail transfer agent (Exim),
Debian’s apt command is desperate to re-install it.</p>
<p>So I needed to tell the system that I already have a mail transfer
agent. This post explains how I did it. I don’t know if this is the
correct ‘modern’ way to do it, but it worked for me, and it is quite
interesting because it exposes a little of how Apt works under the
hood.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my problem is the use case given in the old Apt Howto
under the section called
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-helpers.en.html">4.1 How to install locally compiled packages: equivs</a> there is
more useful information there.</p>
<p>The package that helps us to circumvent Debian package dependencies is
called equivs, so first I needed to install that.  sudo apt-get
install equivs</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>sudo apt-get install equivs
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next I ran the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>equivs-control msmtp-git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This created a template Debian control file. I gave it a meaningful
name, i.e. msmtp installed from git.</p>
<p>I added the following lines:</p>
<div class="highlight-control"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="k">Package</span><span class="w">: </span><span class="s">msmtp-git</span>
<span class="k">Provides</span><span class="w">: </span><span class="s">mail-transport-agent</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <cite>Provides</cite> line is the key, it tells the system that a
mail-transport-agent is installed.</p>
<p>Then I created a .deb from this control file.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>equivs-build msmtp-git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Lastly I installed the deb:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>sudo dpkg --install  msmtp-git_1.0_all.deb
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Pretty weird but it works.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/raindeer.png" src="_images/raindeer.png"/>
<p>In the digital humanities when a scholar wants to transcribe and edit
texts such as ancient or medieval manuscripts, that scholar uses her
institution’s own systems (for the rest of this post I will call this
a ‘site’).</p>
<p>In Birmingham we have the Workspace for collaborative editing that I
was the main coder on, this provides editing and analysis facilities
for digital text projects hosted or associated with the University of
Birmingham in some way. There are several of these kind of sites,
maybe even dozens.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/">Textual Communities</a> is another such site, based at the University of
Saskatchewan, wherever that is, however, the difference is that
Textual Communities aims to “provide an infrastructure and tools to
allow anyone, anywhere, interested in a text to contribute to its
study, as part of a community working together.”</p>
<p>Here is a photo of some of the main Textual Communities people:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/textualcomm.png" src="_images/textualcomm.png"/>
<p>So as part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://estoria.bham.ac.uk/">Estoria de Espanna Project</a>, I have been using
Textual Communities and integrating it somewhat with some display and
analysis tools on a server in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Part of the vision from the Textual Communities people is to build a
global editing community, which would imply being an open and
distributed system, not being based on one server.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are performance and reliability drawbacks to
relying on a single server in Canada to hold the data and pass it back
and forth in real time over HTTP.</p>
<p>So the first immediate approach I have taken is to use database
replication.</p>
<div class="section" id="master-slave-model">
<h2>1. Master/slave model</h2>
<p>The immediate steps to make Birmingham back up the Canadian site is a
simple and low level approach and it is a master/slave model.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Master = Canadian Server</p>
<p>Slave = Birmingham server</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>1. Every Hour, the slave server checks that the connecting SSH tunnel
is still up, if it is not it re-establishes it. The SSH tunnel can be
broken by server reboots or network issues.</p>
<p>2. Every time a write happens on the master server, the slave copies
it automatically.</p>
<p>3. The code that builds the edition (the public frontend that is one
of the key project outputs) works from the local copy of the database
which is far more efficient, and if the master goes down, the data is
still available locally.</p>
<p>This takes us 50% of the way but there is a big step missing. You
cannot actually write data to the slave without breaking the approach,
if master is down, and you start writing in the slave, there is no
automatic way to get the changes back.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t scale very easily, adding a new site to the global
textual community is a completely manual process. Beyond three or four
institutions it would be a serious labour cost in maintaining the
whole thing.</p>
<p>So sooner or later, you need to design a high level approach. The rest
of this post is what I have been studying and building little test
prototypes for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-textual-communities-distribution-system">
<h2>2. A textual communities distribution system</h2>
<p><cite>Caveat emptor</cite>: So this the approach I have been working on, it may not be the
approach favoured in the end by the Estoria project or Textual Communities.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/pacman.png" src="_images/pacman.png"/>
<p>Versions of data can be written at different sites and shared between
them, yet what is considered the ‘approved’ or ‘best’ or ‘current’
version may be different at different sites.</p>
<p>Therefore the key to making textual communities into a distributed
system is to separate the sharing of versions from the interpretation
of these versions.</p>
<p>Each site must therefore keep an additional file/directory form of the
data for use by the distribution system. These are plain-text files
that can be easily backed up and easily analysed (a similar format to
the existing textual communities API, see below).</p>
<p>The actual textual community software does not have to be run from
these files, e.g. the Canadian site which uses MySQL can carry on
doing so, but the internal changes to the database are exported in
real time to plain text files in the data directory.</p>
<p>Likewise, changes by other sites can then be read into Canadian MySQL
database from the data files (which changes are accepted and applied
is subject to its merge algorithm, see below).</p>
<p>The data files are organised in a three level directory structure. The
naming of the directories can be interpreted in different ways:</p>
<p>According to an SQL database approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>database_name/table_name/row_id/</div></blockquote>
<p>Or in a document oriented approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>database_name/collection/document/</div></blockquote>
<p>Or in object oriented way:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>object_name_space/object_type/object_id/</div></blockquote>
<p>Inside the lowest level directory are files, each file is a version of
the data fragment expressed in (or at least wrapped) in JSON. The
system of distribution does not actually care what fields are inside
the file.</p>
<p>For example, a transcription of a page in the textual communities API
is already expressed in this format with a field called “text” which
contains the TEI XML text, as well as other fields (id, user, doc,
create_date, commit_date, prev, next).</p>
<p>The first version of this data file would be named like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>textual_communities/transcripts/1688800/1.json</div></blockquote>
<p>New versions are written according to a principle called
copy-on-write. When a new version is written, the old file is left
alone, the new file is called:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>textual_communities/transcripts/1688800/2.json</div></blockquote>
<p>There is also a symbolic link called ‘current’, this points to what is the
current canonical version of the data (for this particular site).</p>
<p>Different people at different sites can generate new versions of the
file, which are automatically shared using <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. However, what
‘current’ points to depends on a site specific algorithm.</p>
<p>The simplest algorithm is to point current at the file with the
highest integer in the file name, however, sites with editors and
crowd sourcing etc will not do that, current will only be re-pointed
when the editor (the scholar) has approved it.</p>
<p>Groups of sites can have the same of or different algorithms, it does not
affect the system of distribution.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/gitbranch.png" src="_images/gitbranch.png"/>
<p>Since data files are tracked and shared using git, this creates metadata
that can be used to power a user-friendly web frontend for editors to
see new versions, approve/disapprove them and look at history.</p>
<p>When a new version is approved by the local editor, current is repointed
to the new file, if the version is not approved, it is just
ignored. Undoing a new version is moving current to the older file,
the rejected change is just ignored.</p>
<p>Using plain files and git solves many problems with crowd sourcing and
distributed editing without having to write the software ourselves.</p>
<p>When the files are used, e.g. they are loaded into the Canadian site’s
MySQL database, the file pointed to by current is uploaded, the other
files can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>Git has an event based system known as ‘hooks’. So for example, when a
new version of a file is created at a site, various actions can
happen, such as notifying the relevant local editors that a newer
version is available and can be approved or ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beyond-textual-communities-digital-editions">
<h2>3. Beyond Textual Communities - Digital Editions</h2>
<p>While it is somewhat parochial to talk about the project I am working
on, others in the global “Textual Communities” may have the same
aspirations and problems. Eventually you want to take the live form of
the text and turn it into digital editions.</p>
<p>The previous projects I was working on used Python and MongoDB for
serverside applications, but increasingly I am using IndexedDB,
Javascript and HTML5 to make the local browser do the work and allow
the user to continue offline.</p>
<p>These data directories can, more or less, be exposed via the web server
to Javascript as is, just with a few bits of censoring any relevant
private information. This is several orders of magnitude more
efficient than an application server like Django or Ruby on rails
serving the data.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/bplustree.png" src="_images/bplustree.png"/>
<p>I have been working on a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B+tree">B+Tree</a> representation of the Estoria de
Espanna project data to provide search and a fast web frontend, these
can be read directly from the data files.</p>
<p>A fast web server like Nginx throwing out static files combined with
B+tree index for searches is pretty much unbeatable in terms of
performance. It is also pretty future proof - stupid lasts longer than
clever! The importance of this cannot be overstated in externally
funded projects that exist for their period of project funding and
then afterwards are maintained on a while-we-can basis.</p>
<p>Also, I am hoping to produce native mobile applications as part of the
Estoria project output, compiling an abridged version of the data
files directly into the app is far easier and has far better
performance than trying to port web application code to a phone by
statically linking in a Python interpreter.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/mounted.jpg" src="_images/mounted.jpg"/>
<p>In this post we look at the changes in disk mounting and then look at
the udisksctl command which allows you to automount disks from the
command line. Feel free to skip past the background info if you just
want to learn how to use the command.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the beginning (Thursday, 1 January 1970?) to add a storage device
(such as a hard disk) to a computer was an infrequent affair, and
required the machine to be turned off.</p>
<p>So the classic system of disk mounting on a Posix (‘Unix-like’) system
was for the system administrator to list all the disks in a plain text
file systems table, which on most systems can be found in the file
/etc/fstab.</p>
<p>Nowadays servers often have the ability to add and remove disks
without turning the machine off. Even in desktop computers, SATA
drives have this facility too at least according to the SATA drive -
but it depends a lot on the manufacturer of motherboard controller
actually following the standard so it is not usually worth the risk.</p>
<p>The main thing that has really brought hotplugging into use is
external disks such as USB drives and other trendy connectors that
come and (mostly) go such as Firewire, eSata, Thunderbolt, etc.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/duck.jpg" src="_images/duck.jpg"/>
<p>In the early 2000s, the first attempt to cope with this was called
HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer, which did what it said on the tin,
provided a layer between device nodes and the user of the nodes, so
storage devices (and other hardware) can be added and removed without
rebooting this system and without rewriting the /etc/fstab file.</p>
<p>Then everything gets replaced a dizzying number of times (DeviceKit,
devfs, etc) as better approaches are discovered in a fast moving
period of hardware development, udev eventually won and was the main
thing for the rest of the decade.</p>
<p>When a device is added or removed from the system, the Linux kernel
notices and sends out an event. Udev is a daemon that waits around
listening for these events and then responding accordingly. udev runs
in user space not kernel space which is good for security as you
cannot plug in a USB stick and take over the kernel like on some
proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>In 2012, the <a class="reference external" href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hotplug.devel/17392">udev project merged</a> into the systemd project; systemd is
the next generation (or current generation for some distributions)
system and service manager. Systemd is really cool and is being
adopted by most of the major distributions but it is still a year or
two away in some cases depending on their release cycles.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that if you want to control disks on the command
line and you are using the mount command you are 20 years out of
date. Enough history, lets get to the flesh.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/usb.jpg" src="_images/usb.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-line-usage">
<h2>Command Line Usage</h2>
<p>When you hot plug disks in the system, the graphical interface
automatically reacts and provides buttons to mount, unmount and so
on. However, if you have accessed a machine remotely, or just like to
use the command line, then this post will tell you how to use the same
automounting approach as the GUI.</p>
<p>For a system controlled by udev (or systemd), one command line tool is
called udisks. It has two versions, in the original version 1, the
command is udisks, for the second version udisks2, it is udisksctl.</p>
<p>If you don’t have these commands already installed then you will have
to install the udisks2 or udisks packages. In the case of the Debian
distribution, udisks is in Wheezy and udisks2 is in Jessie. I seem to
have both installed for some reason, possibly because I started at
Wheezy and upgraded to Jessie.</p>
<p>Anyway, we will look at the newest one, udisksctl.</p>

</div>
<p>For a very in depth list of disk information:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl dump
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To mount a filesystem:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You don’t need to give a location, it will sort that out automatically
for you. On my system it mounts the disk at /media/username/label
where username is obviously your username and label is the label of
the disk partition, other distributions may deal with it differently.</p>
<p>To unmount a filesystem:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdb1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the command is unmount with an N, not umount like the
classic command.</p>
<p>Note that these command names autocomplete which is kinda cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="udisks">
<h2>udisks</h2>
<p>The old udisks command is pretty similar except instead of giving a command
name, you give an argument, e.g. to get the full disk information:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisks --dump
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Instead of status, it has –enumerate. This option lists partitions instead
of physical disks like in the newer udisksctl.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="go-forth-and-mount">
<h2>Go forth and mount</h2>
<p>So udisksctl is pretty cool, we can now mount and unmount disks from
the command line in the same way as the GUI. Do remember that the disk
information from the udisksctl dump command can quite be useful when
wanting to know about the disks attached to a system.</p>

            <h1><a href="2014/05/27/python_long_type.html">Python’s Disappearing Long Type</a></h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/robotspider.png" src="_images/robotspider.png"/>
<p><em>Note: everything below refers to the default (missionary position) C
implementation of Python.</em></p>
<p>If you are converting Python code from Python 2 to Python 3, you might
notice that the conversion tool transforms any uses of <em>long()</em> into
<em>int()</em>. If that confuses you, this post will hopefully make it clear.</p>
<p>Before Python 2.2, there was a clear distinction between two of the
Python numerical types, the <em>int</em> type and the Python <em>long</em> type.</p>
<p>Firstly, Python’s <em>int</em> type was implemented as a signed long. So a Python
<em>int</em> takes 32 bits of memory, which while not as efficient as some
really optimised approach using shorter types, is still very fast
indeed.</p>
<p>Secondly, Python’s <em>long</em> type is an integer of unlimited size (well until you
run of RAM - which would be an unrealistically massive number not
useful for anything).</p>
<p>Python’s <em>long</em> type does not map directly to a C type, it is a custom
type implemented in the Python source code somewhere which I guess
uses a C struct or whatever. As you might imagine, using the Python
<em>long</em> type is significantly more RAM intensive and slower than the Python
<em>int</em> type, but in reality it is rarely a problem (see below).</p>
<p>Hans Fangohr <a class="reference external" href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/blog/performance-of-pythons-long-data-type.html">did a little performance testing</a> and found that
Python’s long type is about three times slower than the Python’s <em>int</em>
type.</p>
<p>Unified <em>ints</em> were <a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0237/">brought in for Python 2.2</a>. This starts off as a
Python <em>int</em> but transforms magically to a Python <em>long</em> if it needs
to. Here is how it works in Python 2.2 to 2.7:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775807</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775808L</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'long'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">long</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'long'&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that when we add 1 to sys.maxsize, the result has an L suffix to
denote it is a Python <em>long</em> and no longer a 32 bit number.</p>
<p>In Python 3, it works in a similar the way, however the fact you are
no longer using a 32 bit type is now completely hidden away from the
user:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775807</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775808</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">long</span>
<span class="gt">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span class="nb">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="m">1</span>, in <span class="n">&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span class="gr">NameError</span>: <span class="n">name 'long' is not defined</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This time, when we add 1 to sys.maxsize, the result has no L suffix;
trying to call the long constructor function causes an exception
because it does not exist anymore in Python 3.</p>
<p>Of course, the fun of Python is that being a high level language, we
normally don’t really care as long a we get a number; this is it
rightly got changed it to be one unified type.</p>
<p>One might design a high performance application not to use the Python
<em>long</em> type if it turns out to be a bottleneck. However, normally you
would have other bigger insurmountable bottlenecks in your
software/hardware/network stack so you don’t care about this.</p>
<p>However, if you are working on a multi-language project, especially if
you are using Python alongside a lower level language like C, then it
is useful to know what is going on underneath the Python types.</p>
<p>The Python float type is implemented as a C double. This doesn’t
change across versions. Several other numeric types are available in
Python of course.</p>
<p>So if you see <em>long</em> being converted to <em>int</em> by the 2to3 conversion
tool, now you know why.</p>

<h2>Denarius</h2>
<p>Wars are often an unexpected event, and a lot of the major currency
developments in the 19th and 20th centuries were due to wars. In the
ancient world it was no different. The requirement to quickly gather
resources required an efficient form of money.</p>
<p>During the Second Punic War, in 211 BC, Rome brought out the Denarius,
which means ‘containing ten’ - because one silver Denarius was worth
ten bronze (later copper) Asses.</p>
<p>During the Third Punic war, in 140 BC, Rome decided to go hexadecimal,
where one silver-coloured Denarius became worth 16 copper Asses.</p>
<p>The silver-coloured Denarius was considered a day’s wages for a
soldier. The gold-coloured Solidus varied in value but eventually
stabilised by the 8th century as 12 denarii.</p>
<p>The Romans carried spread currency around and in Britain, the denarius
became the penny but was still written as d until 1971 e.g. 5d for 5
pence.</p>
<p>12d made a shilling, which is the Anglo-Saxon term for the
Solidus. The shilling was in the 16th century pegged to the value of a
cow in Kent market.</p>
<p>Twenty shilling made a pound which was named after the unit of mass, a
pound in cash was originally worth the value of a pound weight of silver
(which is now about £300).</p>
<p>The pound of a unit of mass is itself Roman of course, from libra,
which is why pound is shortened to lb. The pound £ sign was originally
an L. 1 lb in mass is 16 ounces.</p>
<p>Part the deal when Britain applied to join the European Economic
Community in the 1960s and 1970s, was that we got rid of all these
crazy measurements and adopted metric, also known as scientific
measurements, which we did eventually, to a certain extent. For
example, milk, beer and cider are officially sold in units of 568 mL!</p>
<p>So until recently, the idea of non-base 10 measurements was completely
normal.</p>

<p>George Boole was a theologian who was also one of the greatest
mathematicians of the 19th Century.Boole understood mathematics and
religion as intertwined. George Boole believed that studying
mathematics would help reveal a new understanding of God.</p>

<p>The core idea that all knowledge and thought could be reduced to two
factors nothing (0) and God (1), had long been discussed, for example
by the the Jesuit Gottfried Leibniz writing in the 17th
Century. However, Boole had the mathematical knowledge to take the
idea and build a complete system of logic around it.</p>

<p>Traditionally, eight bits was called a byte (more correctly it is an
octet). Four bits is a nibble.</p>

<p>Binary is very low level. The first level of abstraction over binary is called hexadecimal.</p>
<p>In previous lecture, we looked at how and when and where computing was

<p>Now it is easy to convert any binary number to hex. You just split it
up into nibbles from the right.</p>
<p>So this number:</p>
<p>11111011110</p>
<p>Split up is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="mi">0111</span> <span class="mi">1101</span> <span class="mi">1110</span>
  <span class="mi">7</span>    <span class="n">d</span>    <span class="n">e</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So in hex it is 7de.</p>
<p>What number is it in decimal? Well that is more complicated. Going
from binary to decimal requires you to split the binary number up into
parts:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>10000000000 1024
1000000000   512
100000000    256
10000000     128
1000000       64
10000         16
1000           8
100            4
10             2

1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = ?
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So data is electrical impulses in a transistor, which represent 1 and
0, which are then hexadecimal numbers.</p>
<p>Now we have numbers, we can now encode characters. Each character is given a hex number.</p>
<p>So 41 in hex (which is 65 in decimal) is “latin capital letter A”.</p>
<p>There are different encodings (mapping between numbers and characters)
but the only one that really matters in 2014 is called UTF-8 commonly
called Unicode (although there are other forms of Unicode which did
not win).</p>
<p>UTF-8 has room for 1,112,064 different characters and symbols which
aim to represent all of the world’s languages.</p>
<p>The first 128 characters are carried over from an older standard
called ASCII. The first 32 of these are historic control characters
for controlling printers and teletype devices (remember those from a
previous lecture?).</p>
<p>20 in hex (so 32 in decimal) is the empty space, then we get
punctuation, then we get the numbers and so more punctuation etc then
the letters in upper case then some more symbols then the letters in
lower case etc.</p>
<p>This gets us to 7E (126) which is ~, and we have all of the English
keyboard covered. The next 129 characters are Western European
languages (German etc) and then it carries on after that through all
the world’s letters and symbols.</p>
<p>Including some really fun stuff added to give compatibility with
Japanese mobile phones:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f4a9/index.htm">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f4a9/index.htm</a>

<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji</a></p>
<p>So a digital text is a series of these hexadecimal numbers representing
characters and symbols including spaces (20 in hex/32 in decimal) and
control codes such as line breaks (0A in hex, 10 in decimal) and so
on.</p>
<p>Here is a nice chart version of the first 127 (ASCII) characters:
<a class="reference external" href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html">http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html</a></p>
<p>So you can decode these characters (with some spaces added to make it
simpler):</p>
<p>41 6e 64 20 74 68 65 72 65 66 6f 72 65 20 6e 65 76 65 72 20 73 65 6e
64 20 74 6f 20 6b 6e 6f 77 20 66 6f 72 20 77 68 6f 6d 20 74 68 65 20
62 65 6c 6c 20 74 6f 6c 6c 73 3b 20 49 74 20 74 6f 6c 6c 73 20 66 6f
72 20 74 68 65 65 2e</p>
<p>To make it clear that something is a hex value, it is often prefixed
with 0x or x or U+.</p>
<p>This is as good as it far as it goes. But to make practical use of the
data, just loads of text doesn’t help that much.</p>
<p>If we want to make a digital representation of a humanities artefact
like a manuscript, we need to use a file format. Otherwise the digital
text is of limited use for other scholars and software.</p>

<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">These</span> <span class="n">Guidelines</span> <span class="n">apply</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">texts</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">any</span> <span class="n">natural</span> <span class="n">language</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="nb">any</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">any</span> <span class="n">literary</span> <span class="n">genre</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">text</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">without</span> <span class="n">restriction</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">form</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The guidelines can be found online here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/">http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/</a></p>
<p>The TEI was initially SGML based then became XML based. What this
means is that the text of the artefact is typed up, and meaning and extra information is inserted into the text using angle brackets.</p>
<p>An example of a text encoded using the TEI format:
<a class="reference external" href="http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/718/1/47.xml">http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/718/1/47.xml</a></p>
<p>So in this simple line here:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"6"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">testimonium</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The element &lt;w&gt; which means word, has an attribute n with value 6
which quite obviously tells us that it is word number 6. The text of
the word then follows, and then the word ends with a closing tag: &lt;/w&gt;</p>
<p>As explained in the preface to the TEI guidelines, part of the reason
for them was to enable sharing of data and a new generation of shared
TEI-supporting software to emerge.</p>
<p>Sadly that never really happened. The problem with the TEI is that it
is a huge standard that doesn’t really simplify the problem space in
any way. There are hundreds of available elements and every author of
a TEI document uses their own subset it in his/her own way.</p>
<p>Churchill famously said that “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”</p>
<p>TEI is the worst form of encoding, except for all the other forms that have been tried from time to time.</p>

<h2>Trams: a case study in technology</h2>
<p>In 1700, what we now call South Birmingham was a patchwork of small
subsistence tenant farms, but as people left the land to work in
factories and other industrial jobs, these farms gradually became larger.</p>
<p>Here is a map of Birmingham in 1831, as you can see South Birmingham
does not really exist yet. The built up areas are what is now known as
the city centre:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/birmingham1831.png"><img alt="Image of Birmingham in 1831" src="_images/birmingham1831_small.png"/></a>
<p>One of these larger farms was called the Grange Estate, in the
following image, Isaac Bate and his family pose outside the farmhouse
in 1876:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/batesfamily.png"><img alt="Image of a Grange Farmhouse" src="_images/batesfamily_small.png"/></a>
<p>At the turn of the 20th Century, there was a massive housing boom and
the Grange Estate was bought in 1895 and zoned for housing and roads.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/grangeplan.png"><img alt="../../../_images/grangeplan_small.png" src="_images/grangeplan_small.png"/></a>
<p>It is like Sim-City, everything needed for the good life is provided,
including shops and the important combination of a church and a
brewery.</p>
<p>Victorian industrial workers would walk or cycle along quiet
tree-lined avenues and then take the tram and train for longer
distance travelling.</p>
<p>So far so good. You will notice there is no car parks, no off street
parking, no garages. The total number of cars in the world was at this
point was approximately 25, most of which were Benz hand made cars in
Germany.</p>
<p>However, after the war, the brave new world required that the trees,
train station and tramlines were all removed to make more space for
the motorcar.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/morrisminor.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/morrisminor_small.png" src="_images/morrisminor_small.png"/></a>
<p>The Grange Estate is now overflowing with cars, and the Alcester Road is
a traffic jam for much of the day. Traffic accidents are the leading cause of
death for children and Birmingham is one of the most obese cities in Europe.</p>
<p>Car ownership in Birmingham peaked at 50% of households, one of the
highest rates of car ownership for a large city. There is not, and
never will be, enough space for everyone to own a car in dense urban
areas like Birmingham.</p>
<p>Cars socially exclude people who do not own them, and are dangerous to
people walking and cycling, and prevent community building as you
cannot talk to other residents while stuck in a small metal box.</p>
<p>There are currently 380,000 cars in Birmingham (8000 are added every
year). As the population of Birmingham is predicted to continue
growing, the car is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The council
have produced a plan:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/birmingham_transport_plan.png"><img alt="../../../_images/birmingham_transport_plan_small.png" src="_images/birmingham_transport_plan_small.png"/></a>
<p>You guessed it, the plan is to reopen the train stations and put the trams
back. Getting us precisely back to where we were in 1896.</p>
<p>The new Birmingham trams have a maximum capacity of 210. Cars in Birmingham
have an average occupancy rate of 1.2.</p>
<p>A car driven for an hour every day, spends 4% of its time in use,
96% of its time rusting and getting in the way.</p>
<p>Cars are overproduced and inefficiency used. However, this
overproduction has provided large numbers of good jobs - 145,000 in
the UK alone currently work in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>If everyone moves to trains, trams and bikes, where do the jobs come from?</p>
<p>If Birmingham gets its comprehensive tram network, it needs just 120 tram sets to provide transport for the whole city (service every 6 minutes each way).</p>
<p>What does Birmingham’s 60 year love affair with the car tell us about
technology?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Increased technological efficiency destroys jobs (while creating
others).</li>
<li>Sometimes you have to go “back to the future”</li>
<li>Not all new technologies are necessarily a good idea</li>
<li>Technology is never un-invented, everything survives somewhere but
the rate of growth or decline is the important thing to notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The history of the computer is much like the history of the tram.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-real-history-of-computing-short-version">
<h2>The real history of computing (short version)</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/jacquard_loom.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/jacquard_loom_small.jpg" src="_images/jacquard_loom_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The first programmable object is the Jacquard Loom in 1801, it used
punch cards which allowed different weaving patterns.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Ada_Lovelace.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Ada_Lovelace_small.jpg" src="_images/Ada_Lovelace_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The digital age almost begins in 1843, when Lady Ada Lovelace (the
daughter of poet Lord Byron) wrote the first computer programme,
algorithm for Charles Babbage Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli
numbers.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/adalovelaceplaque.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/adalovelaceplaque_small.jpg" src="_images/adalovelaceplaque_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The programme was written as part of a set of examples of what could
be run on Charles Babbage’s computer the Analytical Engine. Sadly, the
British government decided to cancel his research funding so this
machine was never finished, but it would have been the first general
purpose digital computer.</p>
<p>Here is his earlier machine called the difference engine:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Babbage_Difference_Engine.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Babbage_Difference_Engine_small.jpg" src="_images/Babbage_Difference_Engine_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The digital age tries to begin again in 1936 when Alan Turing explains
in a seminar paper that any real-world general-purpose computer or
computer language can approximately simulate any other real-world
general-purpose computer or computer language, i.e. it is “Turing
complete”.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/Alan_Turing_photo.jpg" src="_images/Alan_Turing_photo.jpg"/>
<p>Turing went on to create this, the Bombe, a machine designed to
decipher encrypted German messages during World War II.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Bletchley_Park_Bombe.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Bletchley_Park_Bombe_small.jpg" src="_images/Bletchley_Park_Bombe_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The successor was called Colossus, and is starting to be a
recognisable computer.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/colossus.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/colossus_small.jpg" src="_images/colossus_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>Alan Turing was not appreciated during his lifetime, to put it lightly. However, now he is a man of many memorials, including these:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Alan_Turing_Olympic_Torch.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Alan_Turing_Olympic_Torch_small.jpg" src="_images/Alan_Turing_Olympic_Torch_small.jpg"/></a>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Turing_Plaque.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Turing_Plaque_small.jpg" src="_images/Turing_Plaque_small.jpg"/></a>

<p>After that we have the first non-military computer, the Manchester
Mark I in 1949, and pretty much from here the digital age has begun.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/mark1.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/mark1_small.jpg" src="_images/mark1_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The next image shows the Atlas, also at the University of Manchester,
the world’s most powerful computer in 1962. It had more computer
capacity than the rest of the United Kingdom put together.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/University_of_Manchester_Atlas,_January_1963.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/University_of_Manchester_Atlas,_January_1963_small.jpg" src="_images/University_of_Manchester_Atlas,_January_1963_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>This is the 1970 PDP-11 operated here by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/pdp11.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/pdp11_small.png" src="_images/pdp11_small.png"/></a>
<p>Thompson is sitting at a teletype terminal. Where you code into
the keyboard and the computer responds by printing out the result.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Teletype_with_papertape_punch_and_reader.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Teletype_with_papertape_punch_and_reader_small.jpg" src="_images/Teletype_with_papertape_punch_and_reader_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>Shortly afterwards, video terminals were invented. Such as this one:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/DEC_VT100_terminal.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/DEC_VT100_terminal_small.jpg" src="_images/DEC_VT100_terminal_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>It may look like a computer, but it is actually just a screen and a
keyboard, all the processing happens in the mainframe computer
elsewhere.</p>
<p>These type of computers can and normally did had multiple terminals,
sometimes in other rooms or other buildings.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Digital.PDP-11.1970.102646128.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/Digital.PDP-11.1970.102646128_small.png" src="_images/Digital.PDP-11.1970.102646128_small.png"/></a>
<p>In the 1970s, it was called time-sharing. Hundreds or thousands of
terminals could share the same mainframe - which would be maintained
and updated by specialists.</p>
<p>I love this next photo, the guy in the front looks like he has the
universal programmer’s tense expression, i.e. ‘Why the heck is this not
working now?’.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/ctrlroom-1.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/ctrlroom-1_small.png" src="_images/ctrlroom-1_small.png"/></a>
<p>These mainframes ran an operating system called Unix started by
Thompson and Ritchie. The different terminal users could communicate
with each other and collaborate.</p>
<p>The terminals got smarter over time, and even had graphical front ends
that looked something like this:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/cde.png"><img alt="../../../_images/cde_small.jpg" src="_images/cde_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>This was the start of the modern era of computing. Many programs that were written in the 1970s are maintained today. There is a continuous thread that runs from Lovelace and Babbage, through Turing to the real beginning of the digital age in the 1970s.</p>
<p>So far so good. This is our tram. Next, comes the car, or indeed two of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="personal-computers">
<h2>1. Personal computers</h2>
<p>Here is an early attempt from 1969 to market a home computer.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/cook.png" src="_images/cook.png"/>
<p>This particular model was a commercial failure.</p>
<p>When the PC came out, such this example from 1981, compared to the
Unix systems of the 1970s and 1980s, they were giant step backwards.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/IBM_PC_5150.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/IBM_PC_5150_small.jpg" src="_images/IBM_PC_5150_small.jpg"/></a>
<p>No networking, a single process at once, focused on really dull office
tasks like typing a letter. The biggest problem looking back was the
software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-proprietary-software">
<h2>2. The rise of proprietary software</h2>
<p>Until this point, the source code of all programs had been shared
among the largely academic computing world. Everyone could study and
improve computer programs and share those improvements back to the
community.</p>
<p>With the new idea of proprietary software or closed source software,
you don’t legally own the software anymore, you have merely licensed
the right to use it under certain conditions.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/Windows1.0.png"><img alt="../../../_images/Windows1.0_small.png" src="_images/Windows1.0_small.png"/></a>
<p>The source of the software is not shared, you just have compiled
(unreadable) copy of it. There can now be a difference on what you
think the software does (something useful) and what it actually does
e.g. spy on you.</p>
<p>When you understand this point, you suddenly a realise it is a bad
idea to licence or use any software that cannot be publicly peer
reviewed and fixed.</p>
<p>Proprietary software comes with multiple pages of legalese and asks
you to tick that you not only read it but also understand it. You have
to lie in order to start it, and goes downhill from there.</p>
<p>The Snowden revelations printed <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">in the Guardian</a> have confirmed what
we already knew, that Microsoft software has built-in backdoors for
the NSA to spy on its users. Even scarier is that secret backdoors
created for Microsoft and the NSA could also be exploited by
criminals.</p>
<p>Proprietary software, especially in the form of Microsoft Windows, is
a temporary aberration in the history of the digital. In 50 years
time, Microsoft Windows will be considered as important as this
device:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/peppapig.jpg" src="_images/peppapig.jpg"/>
<p>So lets get back to the trams. There were two massive and related
developments which happened almost in the background, but would come
to dominate the digital world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-free-open-source-software">
<h2>The rise of free/open source software</h2>
<p>In 1983, a famous programmer in MIT called Richard Stallman began the
‘Free Software’ movement. As well as being a well known software
developer (he invented the concept of a live real time text editor and
started the most widely used compiler today - GCC), he best known as a
digital philosopher.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/rms.jpg" src="_images/rms.jpg"/>
<p>Stallman argued that software developers had a moral, ethical and
political duty to enable co-operation and prevent restrictions on the
ability of users to study, examine, peer review, modify and share
software. He argued that proprietary software was anti-social, corrupt
and ultimately self-defeating.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the difference between the terms
‘commercial’ and ‘proprietary’. Software can be ‘commercial’ -
i.e. made by a company for profit, with or without being
proprietary. Likewise a proprietary program may be made available at
cost or at no cost.</p>
<p>He illustrates the concept by comparing ‘a free beer’ with ‘free
speech’.</p>
<p>Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens created a later related concept called
‘open source’, which emphases the practical aspects rather than the
political and ethical ones. For example, the vast majority of software is
not created for sale in packaged boxes but is created use within
companies and institutions where software is not their primary
purpose. So if this software is shared and improved in a community, it
gives added value to those who engage in it.</p>
<p>Almost every major software development of the 1990s and 21st century
has happened within the Free Software/Open Source world including
Linux and Android.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the most famous piece of free/open source software
of them all, the World Wide Web.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-world-wide-web">
<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
<p>In the early 1990s, the best designed and most powerful information
protocol was called Gopher. However, despite its technical strengths,
Gopher eventually lost out because the copyright owner, the University
of Minnesota, wanted to sell it as proprietary software.</p>
<p>And finally a Brit again!</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.zeth.net/images/blog/berners-lee.png"><img alt="../../../_images/berners-lee_small.png" src="_images/berners-lee_small.png"/></a>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee created World Wide Web, which while technically
inferior to Gopher, was free software. Anyone could develop a server
or a client without having to ask or pay anyone for permission. When
WWW became widely shared in 1993, proprietary Gopher was toast. Gopher
was eventually re-licensed as free software in 2000, but it was too
late, WWW had taken over everything.</p>
<p>Finally, desktop computers had similar networking capabilities to
1970s mainframes. While they are a lot of people still using Windows,
these are merely like the 1970s dumb terminals, 83% of web servers are
running free software. Now with Apple OS X (based on FreeBSD Unix-like
system), Linux desktops like Ubuntu and the rise of Android based phones
and tablet (Android is based on the free software operating system
Linux), almost everyone is running a system which is based on the
1970s Unix. The 20 years of the Windows aberration is coming to a close.</p>
<p>Go Linux, go WWW, go Trams, go bikes!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academia-and-open-source-software">
<h2>Academia and Open Source Software</h2>
<p>Most UK and EU funding bodies now require that any software produced
in a research project is released as open source software. Software
developers within the academy, especially those in the humanities, are
unlikely to be allowed to large pay licensing fees and are expected to
use open source tools wherever possible.</p>
<p>Any project that uses the digital is likely to involve some open
source software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beyond-open-source">
<h2>Beyond Open Source</h2>
<p>The WWW has enabled collaboration in many areas, not just
software. Principles and ideas from open source have been applied to
other fields.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Freedom of Information - providing open access to government
documents through the Web</li>
<li>Open Access - unrestricted access via the Web to peer-reviewed
journal articles and primary data.</li>
<li>Crowd sourcing - creating content by soliciting contributions from
online communities - Wikipedia being a prominent example</li>
<li>Crowd funding - funding projects through soliciting contributions
from web users - e.g. Kickstarter</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="digital-conduct">
<h2>Digital Conduct</h2>
<p>Collaborative and creative online communities are
self-selecting. People form communities to create something, should
they also be responsible for social justice?</p>
<p>Should these collaborative communities enabled by the web and by
free/open principles have standards of behaviour, if so what should
they be and who polices them?</p>
<p>Increasingly these creative communities have published codes of
conduct, especially regarding communication and discrimination.</p>
<p>Developing-world criticisms: does attempting to regulate conduct in
digital creative communities risk the danger of western (especially US
west-coast) cultural imperialism? How do diversity and social
policies relate to freedom of speech?</p>
<p>Does forcing participants to use real names instead of pseudonyms
cause problems for those with fear of harassment?</p>
<p>How should gender be dealt with in largely male dominated online
communities? Are those who run these communities responsible for
addressing gender imbalances?</p>
<p>Communities that work primarily online but have conferences or social
meetings pose particular issues in terms of harassment/unwanted
attention. E.g. conferences with male to female ratios of 10 to 1 are not
uncommon.</p>
