<p>I would like to tell you a story. This is a story of how we the
British people, and we the planet, got here and more importantly where
we should go next. It is still a work in progress. If you are of a
like mind, please help me to improve it. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="section" id="dogglerland">
<h2>Dogglerland</h2>
<p>After the last Ice Age, Britain was certainly a part of Europe, the
Thames and the Rhine met and Woolly Mammoths and later people walked
across to Britain.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/doggerland.png" src="_images/doggerland.png"/>
<p>However, God decided out of wisdom or for a joke, that Britain should
be an island and smashed the land bridge with the Hammer of the
Waters <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, throughout history, idealists have been trying to glue
Britain back onto Europe, without much success.</p>
<p>However, this unavoidable geological and geographical fact remained
and still remains, and it gave us a very different history to the
continental peoples of Europe. I think it also gives us a very
different future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-dos">
<h2>Rome DOS</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/rome.png" src="_images/rome.png"/>
<p>Julius Caesar’s made expeditions to ancient Britain in 55 and 54 BC,
it was the beginning of a pattern. The Romans could enter Britain and
conqueror territory, but they could not hold it.</p>
<p>Whether is was Boudica, the Iceni queen who burned down the Roman
settlements at modern day Colchester, London and St Albans; the
inability to make progress in the North, modern day Scotland, Wales or
Cornwall; or countless other defeats; the Romans never achieved a
stable position in Britain.</p>
<p>Roman Britain existed within its urban colonies but despite a massive
investment in infrastructure, such as the famous road network,
conquering Britain was never a serious enough priority to divert the
required military forces to subdue the people of Britain once and for
all.</p>
<p>Roman officials and retired veteran troops settled in Britain had a
tendency to go native and side with the locals over Rome, not least
for survival, intermarriage with local tribes brought more security
than the Roman state, which was more annoyed than responsive when the
frequent requests for rescue came. After a few hundred years of
half-hearted efforts of colonisation, Rome stopped answering
altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="charlemagne-and-rome-3-11">
<h2>Charlemagne and Rome 3.11</h2>
<p>However, in Europe, despite the collapse of the Romans, the Byzantine
and Frankish Kings were trying to recreate and hold the Roman Empire,
Charlemagne being the most famous, he conquered a good part most of Western
Europe.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/charlemagne.png" src="_images/charlemagne.png"/>
<p>For those on the continent, they have a 2000 year process of
recreating the Roman Empire. However, we were barely in it to start
with, and haven’t joined since.</p>
<p>While Charlemagne was winning battle after battle, back in Britain,
something very different was happening. As the Romans had faded out,
the Saxons faded in, it wasn’t very long before the Mercian Supremacy
united England under the Saxon Kings and their capital of Tamworth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="normandy">
<h2>Normandy</h2>
<p>William I, also known as William the Conqueror, the first king on the
back of the space-limited 1 foot rulers traditionally given to British
schoolchildren, was cousin and in his own mind at least, heir, to the
previous king Edward the Confessor.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/arrow.png" src="_images/arrow.png"/>
<p>With the arrow through King Harold’s eye, the Anglo-Saxon era of
Britain had ended and the Norman age had begun.</p>
<p>Despite Northern France being their ancestral homeland, the Norman
Kings and their Tudor descendents failed to hold together England and
France, losing Normandy and the rest of their homelands to the Franks.</p>
<p>They had more luck in the westerly direction, conquering the various
little kingdoms in Ireland by war and marriage, while Henry VIII
managed to create a peaceful union with Wales. However, all attempts
to secure a legal heir either by legitimising his son Henry FitzRoy or
divorcing required permission from the Pope.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="english-independence-from-rome-95">
<h2>English Independence from Rome 95</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/charles5.png" src="_images/charles5.png"/>
<p>The Pope had bigger problems than pleasing the English (and Welsh and
Irish) King, Emperor Charles V was once again building a united
Europe. Grumbles about papal rule and (in practice) subservience to
the Holy Roman Empire had been bubbling for many years in parliament
over a range of issues, but the international marriages of the King
had always meant the monarchy was a limit to how far parliament could
act.</p>
<p>Now with the King on the side, the Acts of Supremacy was could be
passed, meaning the King and the secular parliament would now rule the
Kingdom, the role of the Church was confined to moral matters alone,
and England was no longer seen as a minor partner or dependency of the
Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>This also enabled union with protestant Scotland, and James VI of
Scotland became James I of England. Despite the movie of the evil
English killing poor blue painted Mel Gibson and the moans of today’s
Scottish nationalists, it was actually the Scottish that (peacefully)
conquered England.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom was now a confident and powerful country. Freedom
of thought led to the industrial revolution, which we will come back
to later.</p>
<p>Catholic Europe and its supporters did not take this lying down,
England was still a valuable prize to add to a European empire. The
Spanish Armada was the most famous failed attempt at an invasion, and
the Gunpowder Plot tried to blow up parliament with James I inside.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-last-attempts-at-uk-european-integration">
<h2>Two last attempts at UK-European integration</h2>
<p>A more consensual(ish) attempt of European integration was when
parliament invited William of Orange to become the King William III
and so he did. For a brief period it seemed like the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands would become one country. However, William was
childless when he fell of his horse and died, and each Kingdom had
different rules over the succession, and that was that.</p>
<p>Next in line was his sister in law, Queen Anne, the last truly English
monarch. Under her rule there was a major humanitarian crisis on the
continent. King Louis of France decided to commit genocide against the
Huguenot people and wipe them out in a series of massacres, half a
million left France in a giant exodus.</p>
<p>Queen Anne opened Britain’s borders and 50,000 Huguenots moved
here. Queen Anne’s new immigration policy was simple, anyone who
turned up and pledged allegiance to the Queen was immediately part of
the British population.</p>
<p>The open border policy lasted for hundreds of years. The barriers were
only put up fully in the late 20th Century, when we were already in
the European Union.</p>
<p>Anyway, like William, Queen Anne also died childless. What happened
next is quite interesting. Parliament chose the next King from a list
of potentially suitable Princes and Princesses. They settled on George
of Hanover, the 58th in line to the throne and non-English speaking.</p>
<p>We were now in a union with a mid-level German principality, but like
all our other European alliances, it broke down and it eventually the
Kingdom of Hanover became part of the German Empire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="britain-in-the-world">
<h2>Britain in the World</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/britishempire.png" src="_images/britishempire.png"/>
<p>By now Britain had lost interest in European affairs, we were part of
a global Empire on which the sun never set. Lots of terrible evil
things happened, which everyone talks about but also some good things,
which people don’t talk so much about.</p>
<p>On a purely economic level, the Empire was a giant mistake. What
started as an attempt to get a set of sustainable safe ports ended up
covering a quarter of the world. It was the industrial firms of the UK
that had to subsidise the infrastructure of Empire building, and as
other countries got their industrial revolution, the sums no longer
added up.</p>
<p>If we had just defended these ports, and given countries their
independence quicker, would they have been more free? Or would an even
less benign European power have swooped in and taken them?</p>
<p>Anyway, the Empire and all its good and evil and idiosyncrasies
happened. The Commonwealth is there? Why do we ignore it?</p>
<p>We discovered medical treatments and we started Canada, Australia and
New Zealand. From a small patchwork of feudal kingdoms, we united
India - against us of course - but now it is one of the greatest
countries in the world.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/tea.png" src="_images/tea.png"/>
<p>Obviously we cannot take credit for India’s hard work but we did leave
them the world’s largest railway, Westminster-style parliamentary
democracy and the English language which they are using brilliantly to
trade internationally, they are the winners.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth is the growing part of the world, the 21st century is
their century. Why shut them out just to stay in a club of losers?
Lets get stuck in and help the Commonwealth countries develop. The old
masters can become the servants, lets not be too proud and have some
humility.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/textile.jpg" src="_images/textile.jpg"/>
<p>The Empire was not a one way street, we learned a lot from the
Commonwealth peoples. We got tea, carpets, colourful patterns and new
artistic and musical forms, new philosophies and our national
obsession with curry.</p>
<p>By being exposed to the world, the values of the British people
started to change. We realised that people were not so different. We
went into the world as gold-hungry pirates but started coming back
with new values.</p>
<p>The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade started
from those who had gone out into the Empire and not found blood
thirsty savages, but instead found friends and lovers, decent human
beings. To make sense of it they went back to the New Testament notion
that God made all men are equal and all men are our brothers.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/antislavery.jpg" src="_images/antislavery.jpg"/>
<p>This came to a head when the great Christian leader and
parliamentarian William Wilberforce led the social and parliamentary
campaign to abolish slavery.</p>
<p>Since everyone is our brother and sister, all men should be made free
of slavery, oppression and poverty and it is our responsibility as
human beings to make it happen, to bring freedom to the world. Not
wait for the oppressed to take back their own freedom, it is
everyone’s job, especially the advanced country that is Britain.</p>
<p>This sounds simple and obvious now, but in the late 1700s this was a
radical idea, the first time it had been exposed.</p>
<p>It is an unavoidable historical fact that this was a British (and
Dutch) movement. During this period, Germany and much of continental
culture was going in a totally opposite direction, building the
foundations of fascism.</p>
<p>I don’t say this for nationalistic reasons but to point out that human
rights did not start because of the EU. We were already starting to
take a first step down this path three hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why God brought the hammer down on Doggerland, to give
us a more global perspective. Once you have built a boat to sail to
Europe, you can use that same boat to explore the world, then you find
that everyone is a human being.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-last-patriot">
<h2>The last patriot</h2>
<p>American Independence is today framed as a fight for freedom, Mel
Gibson being killed (again) by the evil English, and to a large extent
that is accurate. However, what they don’t like to mention is that one
of the factors driving American Independence was a fear among American
slave owners that Britain was going wobbly on slavery. They were
right, we were.</p>
<p>What is also true is that the newly independent America went backwards
on the rights of Black people and native Americans for the first 50 to
75 years.</p>
<p>One thing that the British navy based in its territory in Canada liked
to do was to go down to plantations in the American south and rescue
slaves, many thousands of whom settled in Canada and in the UK.</p>
<p>We should have done more. We should have freed every last slave, even
if it meant abolishing the US government and killing Mel Gibson a
third time. All people are equal. Those who are oppressed we must
help.</p>
<p>All Britons got free healthcare in 1948. If you are black in America
today you are three times as likely to not have decent health
insurance than a white person. America was 75 years behind us in 1800
and it is still 75 years behind now.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is not the time to import the US health care system
via TTIP. Sadly, the EU has it on the cards and we cannot escape it
while being a member. If you or your family has what the Americans
call ‘pre-existing condition’, then expect significantly worse and
more expensive healthcare than we have now.</p>
<p>I actually love Americans and American culture. I hate their war
mongering governments. I love San Francisco and hate Washington DC.</p>
<p>We should have free trade with America, but at the moment the American
government is only offering take or it leave it terms. I think we
should leave it.</p>
<p>I also dislike the idea that to criticise the American government is a
problem. I don’t want to live there. I don’t want UK to become America
either. I don’t want their ideas about private healthcare, GMO foods,
Fracking or a culture based on the ownership of guns.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-xp-world-war-i">
<h2>Rome XP: World War I</h2>
<p>When Napoleon tried to create a united Gallic Europe, we were going to
lose our essential pit stop of Malta and possibly lose access through
Mediterranean, as well as our allies being attacked.</p>
<p>So we popped over the channel and put Napoleon is his box but lost
interest afterwards. As we saw above, we long ago lost interest in
holding possessions on the mainland of the continent.</p>
<p>So after Napoleon, it was still France that was seen as the potential
trouble maker. In general, in the 19th Century, Relations between
Britain and Germany were very good. Back then Britain still believed
it was a Germanic people, the Anglo-Saxons, and we had our recently
imported German kings. All that was deliberately and rapidly washed
away in the build up to World War II so it is quite hard to comprehend
now.</p>
<p>Our main priority was always free trade routes, as long as we could go
past Europe through the Mediterranean, we didn’t want to interfere in
the continent and they didn’t want to interfere in our empire, we just
wanted happy neighbours.</p>
<p>However, while we were sailing off around the world, causing chaos,
building railways, drinking gin and rethinking what it was to be
British and human. The Europeans were still trying to make the Roman
empire. They couldn’t agree if it would be a French empire or a German
one but now they had better guns which spiralled into World War I.</p>
<p>The Austrian Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by Serbia. The UK tried
to make France and Germany just get along. They didn’t
listen. Politicians and generals on both sides decided this was the
perfect excuse to defeat the other and become the new Roman empire.</p>
<p>When German and France started fighting, we still tried to calm it all
down. The problem was that Britain a had given security guarantee to
Belgium in 1839, not sure the UK even remembered but the
Belgians did. So when on the 4th August 1914, Germany troops marched
through Belgium to attack France, the guarantee was triggered.</p>
<p>The British public was totally confused, weren’t we a Germanic people?
Isn’t France the country of Napoleon? Aren’t France the bad guys? Why
do we even care about Belgium anyway?</p>
<p>In the confusion of complex European politics, to the government
honouring the deal with Belgium seemed like a precise and specific
aim that didn’t require a master plan for the continent.</p>
<p>The government decided it could clear out Belgium and be back home in
a week, back home in time for Christmas, back home in time for New
year...</p>
<p>We went into World War I as a naval power with little recent
experience of fighting warfare on land against an equally advanced
enemy. Sea battles against an inferior foe last a day or two, maybe a
couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The War dragged on for 4 long years and we lost a million of our best
and brightest people for no gain whatsoever. Progressive social
changes started going backwards. Long promised reforms and freedoms
promised to Ireland were delayed by the war and we lost them. We
bankrupted ourselves and started to lose the whole Empire. We even
killed Mel Gibson again at the incompetently run campaign at
Gallipoli.</p>
<p>France continued Empire building in the Treaty of Versailles, trying
to guarantee a permanent superiority over Germany. The UK delegation,
“the Heavenly Twins”, bankers who were brought in as “worthy finance
experts”, despite advice from Keynes in the Treasury to prioritise
making sure post-war Germany was viable and don’t worry about making
money, decided it wanted a huge pile of money out of Germany too.</p>
<p>If only people today would learn to ignore bankers and ‘worthy’
figures of high finance and listen to Keynes, maybe we would not have
the financial crash, the Greece crisis, or in fact World War II.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-7-world-war-ii">
<h2>Rome 7 - World War II</h2>
<p>Between the wars, America had started to make aggressive moves against
Britain and its empire, so wasn’t even looking at Nazi Germany. If any
threat loomed it was from those evil red communists in Russia.</p>
<p>Britain likewise hardly noticed, struggling to deal with colonial
demands for independence.</p>
<p>When the first moves in Hitler’s game started, many assumed it was
just a corrective to the Treaty of Versailles. Maybe partly it was,
but Hitler had got the taste of momentum and was never going to stop.</p>
<p>Hitler, like those before, wanted his own version of a united
Europe. Mussolini even used the Roman symbolism directly.</p>
<p>Hitler called Charles V’s Holy Roman Empire (see above) the First
Reich. Bismarck’s Prussian Empire was the Second Reich, and Hitler’s
own rise to power was the Third Reich, the third German attempt at a
pan-European state (ignoring all the other attempts).</p>
<p>This time, it really could not be ignored. Hitler’s grand vision of a
united Europe left no room for anyone else, whether internal
minorities such as the Jews, or external powers such as Britain.</p>
<p>Germany was the master race, a white Europe united under one
government with white troops wearing even whiter shirts.</p>
<p>Britain stood alone against Hitler!</p>
<p>Erm well no. Not really at all.</p>
<p>Forces that the UK fielded were a multi-racial bunch. As well as my
Granddad and other British residents and thousands of Australians and
Canadians, we had 2.5 million Indian volunteers, we had a Burma
Division, a Fiji Infantry Regiment, the Royal Malay Regiment, the Arab
Legion and Africa sent six whole divisions of black African
volunteers. It goes on and on.</p>
<p>In the following image, comrades look on as a West African soldier is
treated by doctors. Many thousand Africans and a million Indians died
for our freedom.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/west_african_casualties.jpg" src="_images/west_african_casualties.jpg"/>
<p>Despite all the injustices, problems, disagreements, desires for
independence, etc, when we needed them, the Commonwealth was there for
us. We wouldn’t even have a UK if it was not for them.</p>
<p>Oh yeah and even the Americans came. Eventually. Thanks. We love
you. God bless America.</p>
<p>The multi-racial international British Commonwealth and America beat
the white European master race and their all-white allies because all
people are equal, all are valid, and all have something to
contribute. You don’t have to live in Europe to be valuable.</p>
<p>In 1972, the UK was still not yet in the EU so our borders will still
largely open to the world, as they had been since the days of Queen
Anne.</p>
<p>Independent Uganda decided to expel all 50,000 of its citizens from
Indian origin. 27,200 of them settled in the UK.  It wasn’t all
easy, there was a lot of racism from the right and support from the
real socialists, but they thrived here and like the Huguenots,
they became an essential part of the UK population.</p>
<p>The Socialist worker at the time tried to explain to the British
people they had nothing to fear:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/swcover.jpg" src="_images/swcover.jpg"/>
<p>It is the racist financial elite and the mainstream media that tries
to people of Britain against our cousins in the Commonwealth, and they
still do it today.</p>
<p>The Guardian is nice, it has a handy app that means I can read it on
the toilet, but it is not a left-wing paper, it is a right-wing
mainstream media paper like the rest. This is the age of the Internet,
diversify your information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rome-10-the-european-union">
<h2>Rome 10 - The European Union</h2>
<p>A factor in the wars between France and Germany is that the bordering
areas are rich in natural resources. Sharing them helps to prevent
arguments which makes peace. In this context the post-war European
Coal and Steel Community makes a lot of sense. But Britain has never
dug the Ruhr. It doesn’t mean anything to us.</p>
<p>Brussels is the mid-point between France and Germany, good location
for them but it doesn’t mean anything to UK except the site of some
stupid unnecessary wars between France and Germany where our
grandparents and great-grandparents suffered. We did not need to join
the EU to stop us conquering France or Belgium. UK has been finished
with that since 1534.</p>
<p>So the fact the symbolism of the EU means more to France and Germany
and means little to UK, doesn’t come us much surprise.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/greece.jpg" src="_images/greece.jpg"/>
<p>The EU used to be like a benign attempt at a Roman Empire, but it has
become increasingly hostile to its own people, see what happened in
Greece, and it is increasingly out of step with British values, go
read about TTIP. Read about the Viking Line labour dispute. The EU has
long ceased to be a progressive force, if it ever was.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/greece2.jpg" src="_images/greece2.jpg"/>
<p>It has a centralised, proprietary setup where the only people that can
influence decisions are yesterday’s multinational corporations. It
then puts a phoney parliament on top as a democratic fig leaf. The
European ‘Parliament’ has two fancy state of the art buildings that it
shuttles between. What it cannot do is make any new laws or repeal any
old ones. Only the unelected Commission can write new laws, as for
repealing laws, there is not a system for that. What a joke!</p>
<p id="party1999">In 1999, I was an undergraduate with a giant EU flag on the wall of my
dorm. I read all the propaganda, went on all the trips. I wrote essays
saying while the EU was currently undemocratic, bad for the
environment, and bad for the developing world, it would be fixed
soon. It wasn’t. All we had to do was co-operate and wait and it will
reform. It didn’t.</p>
<p>I even waited in the Snow in 2002 outside the Bank of Finland to get
some of the first Euros. What a mistake the Euro was, it has
bankrupted Greece and left many of the young people of Europe without
a hope of jobs.</p>
<p>Those who funded the Remain campaign are the same people that caused
the financial crisis of 2008: Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and
J.P. Morgan. They are not our friends or allies.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/disabled.jpg" src="_images/disabled.jpg"/>
<p>Much is made to dismiss left arguments for exit because Nigel Farage
wants exit. Whatever one may think of him, he has never held power to
hurt anyone and never will have power. Meanwhile, Remain’s George
Osborne has had power and used it to take money from disabled people
and give it to the same billionaires that are backing remain.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/tonyblair.jpg" src="_images/tonyblair.jpg"/>
<p>Then we come to Remain’s Tony Blair.</p>
<p>Britain in recent history didn’t start wars or kill people, yay! We
had finally learned from our past mistakes. That is until the lying
warmonger Tony Blair came along.</p>
<p>My own faith in Britain took a massive nosedive then and probably
hasn’t recovered, maybe it never will, it is now the
cyber-internationale or nothing.</p>
<p>Blair is responsible for choosing to start a war which has killed up
to a million people. I will not stand with him and I will probably not
agree with him on anything. When you take the same side as Blair, I
see you as a right-wing Blairite, I do have to admit that. You have to
to, you are one. It is better to be honest that you are right of me.</p>
<p>I am not a European. I am British and I am a human and like
Wilberforce, I believe being a human is the more important fact.</p>
<p>I don’t see the need for any layers in between.</p>
<p>I believe that a Kenyan or an Indian or an Australian or a native
American is as equal to a Bulgarian or a Hungarian.</p>
<p>The EU means that someone 1000 miles east of me has equal rights to me
in the UK but someone 1000 miles south of me has none. I find that
completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>The real truth is that European countries are all white, that is the
only unifying factor. That is a racist way to order the world.</p>
<p>There is a lot of middle-class European nationalism, as if it is an
acceptable form of nationalism, and an acceptable form of racism. It
is not. To me it just seems like the last 2000 years of re-making the
Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Moving on from being a little Englander is not be a little European,
it is to be a citizen of the whole world.</p>
<p>There is a lot of middle-class sneering at the out campaign, that it
is full of racists and not the right kind of educated people in the
Remain campaign. A racist with a degree is still a racist. The remain
campaign is equally racist. Just one step zoomed out. They are still
putting up trade and immigration barriers to everyone who is not in
the arbitrary group of 28 majority-white countries that is the EU.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a degree, if you are a normal working person sick of
the sneering; I have three degrees, you can imagine one of them is
yours. They don’t mean anything here. Your voice is equal to the most
loftiest expert. Stick to your beliefs. RMT, ASLEF, BFAWU and other
Trade Unions supporting Leave know as much, if not more, than the
forces of neo-liberal capitalism.</p>
<p>The fact is the Europeans don’t have the Commonwealth history and
the relatively happy race relations we have in the UK. We have a
different history. That is fine. Let them get on with their Rome
building.</p>
<p>Britain can leave and rejoin our Commonwealth and the rest of the
world. If Rome 10 still wants to trade with us afterwards, fine, if
not fine. We have a massive balance of trade deficit with them anyway
so not having a trade deal would both hurt and help us.  For Rome 10,
not having a trade deal would only hurt them.</p>
<p>Why do you think we have a massive balance of trade deficit with the
EU in the first place?</p>
<p>If you remember, the Commonwealth is a group of ccountries whose
citizens had stood up and died for us in the war. Before we joined the
EU, we put had trade barriers with to the Commonwealth. We had a
complementary relationship, we sold them cars and machines and they
sold us food, carpets, clothes, tea and so on.</p>
<p>We used to eat cheap food grown without chemicals in the hot sun in
Australia, Africa and India. Now we eat expensive pesticide covered
fruit grown in heated greenhouses in the low countries. Next up with
the EU’s TTIP, we are going to eat American GMO and hormone treated
foods, God help us.</p>
<p>We turned on back on the Commonwealth to join a group of similar
economies in Europe. We tried to out German the Germans and
failed. Why would Germany need to buy our cars or advanced technology?
It can make cars itself and often better.</p>
<p>Putting up trade barriers to complimentary countries was a mistake. We
cannot all do the same thing. We cannot all do everything. We all live
on one planet and we all do best if we all work together.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-information-age">
<h2>The Information Age</h2>
<p>After the Scottish and English reformations, we had growing freedom of
thought and expression, without which the technological and scientific
discoveries of the industrial revolution would not be possible.</p>
<p>The machine, from a simple lever to a super computer, magnifies human
activity. We have combine harvesters, medical equipment,
airplanes. This magnification in productivity has the potential to
bring food, health and wealth to every member of our species.</p>
<p>We also need to think about our planet and the other species we share
it with.</p>
<p>In this informational age, the EU has nothing to offer, it just wants
to bring in software patents so yesterday’s innovators can have
monopoly rent. Where is the European Google? Why is all the innovation
happening in America, India and China?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-neo-liberal-sweatshop-agenda">
<h2>The Neo-liberal sweatshop agenda</h2>
<p>So far the fruits of the industrial revolution, and now the
information revolution, have not been shared very fairly.</p>
<p>There is this horrible propaganda: “immigrants do the jobs British
people are not willing to do”.</p>
<p>Existing residents used to be happy picking vegetables, doing factory
work, doing care work. These used to be fairly paid secure
jobs. People doing these unskilled jobs could afford to buy a house
and all the essentials of life.</p>
<p>They did not suddenly become work shy. What happened is that secure
contracts were replaced with insecure agency work with serf-like
conditions. Local people cannot afford to take them and still raise
their families. If your family is abroad where the living costs are
lower, then maybe you can make it work but you are still being
exploited.</p>
<p>If it is not good enough for a British person, it is not good enough
for an Eastern European. Building our economy on the exploitation of
Eastern Europe is no more ethical than building an Empire on the backs
of Africans and Indians.</p>
<p>This was a choice, none of this happen by accident, it was designed to
happen, and the forces of neo-liberalism are becoming very rich
because of it.</p>
<p>The stupid thing is that companies with well paid workers in safe
conditions using machines, lose contracts to cowboys hiring mass
numbers of workers in unstable situations, both here and abroad. It is
a technological de-evolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enter-the-matrix">
<h2>Enter the Matrix</h2>
<p>Progress goes backwards but it also goes forwards again. Even if
temporarily a sweatshop is cheaper than a machine, we can make more
productive machines. If an industrial process makes pollution, we can
make cleaner machines.</p>
<p>The future of our species is not about providing low paid insecure
work, it is about using technology to automate and make work
productive enough that we can give everyone decent and fair
conditions.</p>
<p>We need more automation, more machines, and yes more developers
writing software to run it all.</p>
<p>In the Terminator movies, the real hero is not the gun toting Sarah
Conner, it is Skynet. In the Matrix, the hero is Agent Smith.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/everyone.jpg" src="_images/everyone.jpg"/>
<p>I don’t want to make Rome, I want to make the Matrix. I want us to
work with the whole world and help give them all food, clean water,
healthcare, computers and freedom.</p>
<p>The real conservative forces of high finance, the same guys that run
the mainstream media and control the EU, of course want to convince
you to remain. For me, it is part of the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>Maybe we don’t leave this EU this week, I hope we do but the polls are
not looking good, people are accepting the Goldman Sach’s funded
messages. David Cameron won two referendums already using his
anti-progressive project fear. I can believe he can win this one too.</p>
<p>However, we will leave in the end, it is just a matter of time, and we
will not be the only ones. Across Europe, people are waking up. We
don’t need a centralised proprietary government in Brussels to work
together across borders. People are coming up with new models for open
source government and distributed co-operation. We have just got to
pull the arrow of neo-liberalism out of our eyes.</p>
<p>A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of technological
utopianism. The idea of socialism has existed for a long time, but
only now are we finally getting to a technological level where it can
become possible.</p>
<p>Lets make it happen.</p>

            <h1><a href="2016/05/17/pirate_gamepad.html">The Case of the Pirate Gamepad</a></h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/pirategamepad.jpg" src="_images/pirategamepad.jpg"/>
<p>I made some software (which will be explained in a future post) and
used my trusty Argos third-party PS3 style gamepad to control it.</p>
<p>On the way to open sourcing it, I thought I had better try it with a
an official Sony PS3 gamepad, and I could always do with another
gamepad for when playing computer with the sprog.</p>
<p>We play a lot of open source games like SuperTuxKart and Frogatto
which are two of our favourites. To be honest we play almost every
game made available through Debian’s Apt.</p>
<p>So not really thinking too heavily about it, I popped onto a leading
auction website, typed in PS3 gamepad, saw that the first result cost
less than £13 including postage, and just bought it and moved
on. Total time spent was about a minute.</p>
<p>Later I thought it was a bit cheap but ignored the thought on the
basis that the PS3 is ten years old and has been long replaced by the
PS4. The controller that game was the one above. In the following box.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/piratebox.jpg" src="_images/piratebox.jpg"/>
<p>Initial impressions were that it was a little light and the D-pad was
different than I remember. However, it is probably been 5 years since
I touched an official PS3 gamepad and maybe they made production
improvements to make it lighter or I didn’t really remember right.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I plugged it in, and typed <cite>dmesg</cite>, the controller
itself confessed to its real identity.:</p>

<p>The controller was totally fake!</p>
<p>So it didn’t help me generalise my software. Also these controllers
contain a Lithium battery so I am not comfortable putting this
counterfeit device in my child’s hands. If they are so far beyond the
legal system that they do not need to care about the trademarks of
Sony, how much do they care about electrical safety? Or chemical
safety?</p>
<p>So I emailed my findings to the seller and they gave me an immediate
refund and didn’t need to send the controller back. A counterfeiter
with great customer service! Bizarre.</p>
<p>It is amazing the level of detail they went to. It is itself an
interesting cultural artefact; a Chinese made plastic product
pretending to be a different Chinese made plastic product. It is
interesting philosophical discussion about if you use the same design,
make it in the same place and maybe even use the exact same parts,
what does genuine actually mean?</p>
<p>And what the heck is the markup on the official Sony controller if
another company can make an almost exact replica for a less than a
third of the price?</p>
<p>It is shame that people feel the need to be dishonest. A third party
PS3 controller does not need to hide its true nature. I love my Argos
one which has some useful extra features.</p>
<p>Surely selling the controller as what it is would be simpler than
having to sneak around and recreate accounts constantly on the auction
site?</p>
<p>If the manufacturer had said, “this is a PS3 compatible gamepad and it
is three times cheaper”, then it could find its own market. While you
are at it, put in a higher capacity battery and better bluetooth
aerial than Sony’s controller and win on both price and quality.</p>
<p>As for me, I bought an official wired Xbox 360 controller from
Argos. I actually prefer the shape ergonomically and it is more
reliably detected by Linux and is much cheaper than the PS3 gamepad.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/office.jpg" src="_images/office.jpg"/>
<p>This has been a very exciting year. I burst out of the academy and
started a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.infomachine.uk/">new company</a> with a couple of other chaps called Rob and
Luke.</p>
<p>The idea is write a platform to help generate form-based applications,
which could absorb and display business data. We could then in the
future add machine learning/artificial intelligence type features, and
learn original ideas that have not been apparent without such
statistical modelling.</p>
<p>Basically we are trying to make Skynet, the singularity itself, which
we call Infomachine. Of course, being a start-up, it might evolve into
a different concept involving washing machines or something.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/infomachine.png" src="_images/infomachine.png"/>
<p>Meanwhile, some customers found their way to us and we have been doing
lots of consulting and contract software development. The customers
themselves are highly intelligent and beautiful people who have
extensive domain knowledge in their own field, and it has been very
interesting learning some of this as we write software to make their
companies more efficient or expand into new areas.</p>
<p>This all feeds back into the eventual completion of the Infomachine,
or not; maybe we will go in a completely different direction, that is
the fun part, there are just three of us in a (often virtual) room and
we can do whatever the heck we like.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/dancer.jpg" src="_images/dancer.jpg"/>
<p>In this post I thought about the world of cool that lies between
high-level languages and C. Thought is too strong, it is more of a
seed of a thought that has not germinated yet. This is not a fable
with a moral at the end.</p>
<p>When I first came across C#, I thought that is much better than Visual
Basic, perhaps Microsoft’s .Net platform could be interesting one day,
but not personally having an obvious project to use it in, I put it to
one side and have never touched it since.</p>
<p>When Vala was first announced, I thought wow, that is so sexy and I
played with it for about a week. Not personally having an obvious
project to use it in, I put it to one side and have never touched it
since.</p>
<p>I had pretty much the same reaction to Go (aka golang) - wow that’s
cool, perhaps not as sexy as Vala but I like the goroutines. I did the
trendy web based tour, I installed everything locally and played with
the standard library. Then, not personally having an obvious project
to use it in, I put it to one side and have never touched it since.</p>
<p>I could go on and on. Whatever piece of tech that comes into (or back
into) fashion seems to follow this pattern, Haskell, Erlang, Java,
Scala, etc etc. A lot of the developer tools industry and technology
media needs something shiny and new to promote this year.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love all this stuff, I would love to do projects
in different programming languages but obviously, as I have a
reputation for writing Python or JavaScript or doing system
administration, people hire me to do that and don’t perhaps think of
me for other things.</p>
<p>Maybe there is more too it than that, since in whatever I am doing, in
my head I seem to think of any algorithm in Python first as executable
pseudocode even if it gets typed in using JavaScript or another
language.</p>
<p>I had a long stint as an academic, but basically my whole career in
software is as a freelancer or contractor. A journeyman who works to
live.</p>
<p>Often the customer has an existing project or specific library,
toolkit or team which pre-determines the choice of programming
language.</p>
<p>Otherwise, my usual process for creating software is to prototype it
in a high level language (normally always Python but sometimes
JavaScript). 90% of the time, once it works the customer has solved
their immediate problem and wants to move their focus onto their next
problem, which may not be software and may not involve paying
freelance programmers. Sad I know, thanks for all the fish, I am here,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XGX98OW4Rc">like the song says</a>, etc etc :)</p>
<p>When the prototype is working, there is a lot to be done to optimise
it and keep it as a Python application, and almost always there is
some specific other bottleneck (such as network, database or some
industrial requirement) that means that CPU usage is not the problem
and so cutting out the Python interpreter wouldn’t actually make much
difference in the short and medium time-frames that most companies
care about.</p>
<p>Indeed I have seen cases where the customer has gotten someone to
rewrite the prototype application in Java, and found that the new
version is actually slower. A lot of the heavy duty work in the Python
version was actually happening inside a C library that has been highly
optimised over the last 30 years; changing the dependency from that to
a poorly implemented Java library caused the poor performance.</p>
<p>If we imagine a Python application is like a commissioning a
photograph, a C app is commissioning a sculpture. You only do it when
you want something to really last or really be the core of something
fundamental for your future success.</p>
<p>All the above notwithstanding, the genius of Python’s initial design
is that once your application has taken a stable(ish) form, it is
normally pretty straightforward to convert the application to C.</p>
<p>Most of the standard library inherits Linux/Unix best practice (and
even the same function names) and a lot of the best external libraries
in Python are just wrappers around the C equivalents. You always have
the fully working Python application to test it against.</p>
<p>It takes a long time yes, going through line by line, but you are not
troubling the boundaries of computer science or software engineering
as we know it. I actually love those kind of cathartic jobs, but I am
a freak.</p>
<p>Apologies if I am stating the bleeding obvious, none of the above text
is news to anyone, any Python developer knows the same thing, however
it is the foundation for what follows.</p>
<p>So the real reason why I have not personally had an obvious project to
use a lot of these fashionable and ‘cool’ languages and toolkits is
that they fall in the luke-warm middle ground between the extremely
high-level Python (and JS/Ruby/LISP etc) and the low level C language.</p>
<p>For most use cases, all these middle ground languages are slower and
less portable than C. If you have decided on a re-implementation, then
it takes no longer to rewrite a Python project to C than to Go, Java,
C# or whatever, indeed it might often be quicker to C.</p>
<p>I have actually used C hardly at all, far less than I would like to
have done, but I have used these middle-ground languages even
less. Everything just stays in high level code.</p>
<p>So as I warned, I have no moral for this fable, no conclusion to
offer, it is just the beginnings of a thought that ran through my
brain, I like to think I will pick up this theme later, but I will
probably look back in five years to find I have put it to one side and
have never touched it since.</p>

            <h1><a href="2014/06/22/emacs_contacts_application_bbdb.html">Managing Contacts in Emacs with BBDB</a></h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/phonecall.jpg" src="_images/phonecall.jpg"/>
<p>This post is about BBDB (Big Brother Database), which is the main
contacts application available for Emacs.</p>
<div class="section" id="contacts-application-for-emacs">
<h2>Contacts Application for Emacs</h2>
<p>BBDB is packaged within distributions, albeit quite old versions of it
are packaged within Debian at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Information about BBDB can be found at its <a class="reference external" href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/">Savannah homepage</a>, and
most importantly <a class="reference external" href="http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/bbdb/">downloads are found here</a>. I wanted the latest
version so I downloaded it from there.</p>
<p>The latest versions (that begin with 3, e.g. 3.1.2) require Emacs 23
or 24, an older version of Emacs will require version 2 of BBDB;
although it is much nicer for other reasons to use the latest version
of Emacs that you can get.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bbdb.git/plain/README">README</a> gives full instructions to get set up. Basically, like
with most other Emacs libraries, you make the library available by
editing the ~/.emacs file and using the require function.</p>
<div class="highlight-scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">require</span> <span class="ss">'bbdb-loaddefs</span> <span class="s">"/path/to/bbdb/lisp/bbdb-loaddefs.el"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-format">
<h2>Storage Format</h2>
<p>Despite the name ending in DB, contacts are stored in a plain text
file at ~/emacs.d/bbdb (where ~ represents the user’s home directory).</p>
<p>It is worth knowing that each line in the file is a contact, which
takes the form of a vector, this is a LISP data type similar to a
JavaScript Array or Python list (but items are delimited with spaces
rather than commas).</p>
<p>If you ever edit the file by hand or with code you write yourself, it
is important to keep one item to a line, if a line break gets removed
then BBDB will reject the file until you fix it.</p>
<p>Since it is a plain text file, you can do back it up easily, sync it
between computers, write scripts that do things to it, track it with
git or whatever you can imagine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="importing-contacts">
<h2>Importing Contacts</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/adam.jpg" src="_images/adam.jpg"/>
<p>If you already have a load of contacts somewhere, then the best way to
get started is to import them from there. I personally had a load of
contacts in Google Contacts that had been built up from my Gmail
account and Android phone.</p>
<p>I used a lovely little Python script called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deong/charrington">charrington</a> which grabbed
all the contacts from Google and added them to a bbdb file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-bbdb">
<h2>Using BBDB</h2>
<p>As always, M is for Meta which means Alt on an IBM-PC style keyboard.</p>
<p>Typing M-x bbdb allows you to search for a contact. So if I search for
Elizabeth, I get this contact:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/bbdb.png" src="_images/bbdb.png"/>
<p>The other commands all start with bbdb- for example, M-x bbdb-create
allows you to type in a new record. There is almost a hundred
commands, but you do not need to remember them. Using tab completion
shows them all, they are also organised in a toolbar menu.</p>
<p>If you have imported lots of contacts from Google Contacts, then
sometimes different pieces of information about a person are stored
under different names.</p>
<p>One of the most useful things is M-x bbdb-search-duplicates, this
allows you to merge contacts together and/or delete duplicate contacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-mail">
<h2>Sending Mail</h2>
<p>When you have point over a record, pressing m will allow you to
compose an email to the person. Emacs then drops you into message mode.</p>
<p>Email in Emacs is another topic entirely, but if you put the following
into your ~/.emacs file then you have setup the absolute basics:</p>
<div class="highlight-scheme"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">user-mail-address</span> <span class="s">"youremail@example.com"</span>
    <span class="nv">user-full-name</span> <span class="s">"Your Name"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have a mail transport agent or relay (such as mstmp) setup then
Emacs can pass the email to whatever is pointed to by
/usr/sbin/sendmail or you can use Emacs <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/smtpmail/Emacs-Speaks-SMTP.html">itself to relay email</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-features">
<h2>Other features</h2>
<p>Pressing simply e edits the current line. ; allows you to write an
attached note. If the record has a www field then W displays the web
page.</p>
<p>You can even phone your contacts directly from Emacs! Typing M-d will
phone the current contact; obviously you need to have a modem or some
other kind of phone system setup.</p>
<p>Various mail and news packages for Emacs can make use of your contacts
to provide auto-fill functions, e.g. in the To: field of an email.</p>

<p>msmtp is yet another Mail Transfer Agent that merely relays the
outgoing email message to another (e.g. your ISP’s) SMTP server. There
seems to be quite a lot of these, but this one seems to be the most
actively maintained - <a class="reference external" href="http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/">see its homepage on sourceforge</a> for more
information and documentation. At time of writing, the last stable
release is March 9, 2014 which is very recent.</p>
<p>Other similar ones, such as ssmtp, esmtp and nbsmtp, still seem to
work, they are pretty simple programs with few dependencies apart from
the C environment which basically never changes anymore and they are
recompiled and repackaged regularly by the distributions.</p>
<p>I have a machine running on Debian stable but wanted a newer version
of msmtp than is packaged for stable. So I cloned the source code
using git and compiled it.</p>
<p>However, after removing the default mail transfer agent (Exim),
Debian’s apt command is desperate to re-install it.</p>
<p>So I needed to tell the system that I already have a mail transfer
agent. This post explains how I did it. I don’t know if this is the
correct ‘modern’ way to do it, but it worked for me, and it is quite
interesting because it exposes a little of how Apt works under the
hood.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my problem is the use case given in the old Apt Howto
under the section called
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-helpers.en.html">4.1 How to install locally compiled packages: equivs</a> there is
more useful information there.</p>
<p>The package that helps us to circumvent Debian package dependencies is
called equivs, so first I needed to install that.  sudo apt-get
install equivs</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>sudo apt-get install equivs
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next I ran the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>equivs-control msmtp-git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This created a template Debian control file. I gave it a meaningful
name, i.e. msmtp installed from git.</p>
<p>I added the following lines:</p>
<div class="highlight-control"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="k">Package</span><span class="w">: </span><span class="s">msmtp-git</span>
<span class="k">Provides</span><span class="w">: </span><span class="s">mail-transport-agent</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <cite>Provides</cite> line is the key, it tells the system that a
mail-transport-agent is installed.</p>
<p>Then I created a .deb from this control file.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>equivs-build msmtp-git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Lastly I installed the deb:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>sudo dpkg --install  msmtp-git_1.0_all.deb
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Pretty weird but it works.</p>

            <h1><a href="2014/06/12/distributed_global_textual_community.html">A Distributed Global Textual Community</a></h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/raindeer.png" src="_images/raindeer.png"/>
<p>In the digital humanities when a scholar wants to transcribe and edit
texts such as ancient or medieval manuscripts, that scholar uses her
institution’s own systems (for the rest of this post I will call this
a ‘site’).</p>
<p>In Birmingham we have the Workspace for collaborative editing that I
was the main coder on, this provides editing and analysis facilities
for digital text projects hosted or associated with the University of
Birmingham in some way. There are several of these kind of sites,
maybe even dozens.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/">Textual Communities</a> is another such site, based at the University of
Saskatchewan, wherever that is, however, the difference is that
Textual Communities aims to “provide an infrastructure and tools to
allow anyone, anywhere, interested in a text to contribute to its
study, as part of a community working together.”</p>
<p>Here is a photo of some of the main Textual Communities people:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/textualcomm.png" src="_images/textualcomm.png"/>
<p>So as part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://estoria.bham.ac.uk/">Estoria de Espanna Project</a>, I have been using
Textual Communities and integrating it somewhat with some display and
analysis tools on a server in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Part of the vision from the Textual Communities people is to build a
global editing community, which would imply being an open and
distributed system, not being based on one server.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are performance and reliability drawbacks to
relying on a single server in Canada to hold the data and pass it back
and forth in real time over HTTP.</p>
<p>So the first immediate approach I have taken is to use database
replication.</p>
<div class="section" id="master-slave-model">
<h2>1. Master/slave model</h2>
<p>The immediate steps to make Birmingham back up the Canadian site is a
simple and low level approach and it is a master/slave model.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Master = Canadian Server</p>
<p>Slave = Birmingham server</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>1. Every Hour, the slave server checks that the connecting SSH tunnel
is still up, if it is not it re-establishes it. The SSH tunnel can be
broken by server reboots or network issues.</p>
<p>2. Every time a write happens on the master server, the slave copies
it automatically.</p>
<p>3. The code that builds the edition (the public frontend that is one
of the key project outputs) works from the local copy of the database
which is far more efficient, and if the master goes down, the data is
still available locally.</p>
<p>This takes us 50% of the way but there is a big step missing. You
cannot actually write data to the slave without breaking the approach,
if master is down, and you start writing in the slave, there is no
automatic way to get the changes back.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t scale very easily, adding a new site to the global
textual community is a completely manual process. Beyond three or four
institutions it would be a serious labour cost in maintaining the
whole thing.</p>
<p>So sooner or later, you need to design a high level approach. The rest
of this post is what I have been studying and building little test
prototypes for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-textual-communities-distribution-system">
<h2>2. A textual communities distribution system</h2>
<p><cite>Caveat emptor</cite>: So this the approach I have been working on, it may not be the
approach favoured in the end by the Estoria project or Textual Communities.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/pacman.png" src="_images/pacman.png"/>
<p>Versions of data can be written at different sites and shared between
them, yet what is considered the ‘approved’ or ‘best’ or ‘current’
version may be different at different sites.</p>
<p>Therefore the key to making textual communities into a distributed
system is to separate the sharing of versions from the interpretation
of these versions.</p>
<p>Each site must therefore keep an additional file/directory form of the
data for use by the distribution system. These are plain-text files
that can be easily backed up and easily analysed (a similar format to
the existing textual communities API, see below).</p>
<p>The actual textual community software does not have to be run from
these files, e.g. the Canadian site which uses MySQL can carry on
doing so, but the internal changes to the database are exported in
real time to plain text files in the data directory.</p>
<p>Likewise, changes by other sites can then be read into Canadian MySQL
database from the data files (which changes are accepted and applied
is subject to its merge algorithm, see below).</p>
<p>The data files are organised in a three level directory structure. The
naming of the directories can be interpreted in different ways:</p>
<p>According to an SQL database approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>database_name/table_name/row_id/</div></blockquote>
<p>Or in a document oriented approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>database_name/collection/document/</div></blockquote>
<p>Or in object oriented way:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>object_name_space/object_type/object_id/</div></blockquote>
<p>Inside the lowest level directory are files, each file is a version of
the data fragment expressed in (or at least wrapped) in JSON. The
system of distribution does not actually care what fields are inside
the file.</p>
<p>For example, a transcription of a page in the textual communities API
is already expressed in this format with a field called “text” which
contains the TEI XML text, as well as other fields (id, user, doc,
create_date, commit_date, prev, next).</p>
<p>The first version of this data file would be named like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>textual_communities/transcripts/1688800/1.json</div></blockquote>
<p>New versions are written according to a principle called
copy-on-write. When a new version is written, the old file is left
alone, the new file is called:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>textual_communities/transcripts/1688800/2.json</div></blockquote>
<p>There is also a symbolic link called ‘current’, this points to what is the
current canonical version of the data (for this particular site).</p>
<p>Different people at different sites can generate new versions of the
file, which are automatically shared using <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. However, what
‘current’ points to depends on a site specific algorithm.</p>
<p>The simplest algorithm is to point current at the file with the
highest integer in the file name, however, sites with editors and
crowd sourcing etc will not do that, current will only be re-pointed
when the editor (the scholar) has approved it.</p>
<p>Groups of sites can have the same of or different algorithms, it does not
affect the system of distribution.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/gitbranch.png" src="_images/gitbranch.png"/>
<p>Since data files are tracked and shared using git, this creates metadata
that can be used to power a user-friendly web frontend for editors to
see new versions, approve/disapprove them and look at history.</p>
<p>When a new version is approved by the local editor, current is repointed
to the new file, if the version is not approved, it is just
ignored. Undoing a new version is moving current to the older file,
the rejected change is just ignored.</p>
<p>Using plain files and git solves many problems with crowd sourcing and
distributed editing without having to write the software ourselves.</p>
<p>When the files are used, e.g. they are loaded into the Canadian site’s
MySQL database, the file pointed to by current is uploaded, the other
files can be safely ignored.</p>
<p>Git has an event based system known as ‘hooks’. So for example, when a
new version of a file is created at a site, various actions can
happen, such as notifying the relevant local editors that a newer
version is available and can be approved or ignored.</p>

<div class="section" id="beyond-textual-communities-digital-editions">
<h2>3. Beyond Textual Communities - Digital Editions</h2>
<p>While it is somewhat parochial to talk about the project I am working
on, others in the global “Textual Communities” may have the same
aspirations and problems. Eventually you want to take the live form of
the text and turn it into digital editions.</p>
<p>The previous projects I was working on used Python and MongoDB for
serverside applications, but increasingly I am using IndexedDB,
Javascript and HTML5 to make the local browser do the work and allow
the user to continue offline.</p>
<p>These data directories can, more or less, be exposed via the web server
to Javascript as is, just with a few bits of censoring any relevant
private information. This is several orders of magnitude more
efficient than an application server like Django or Ruby on rails
serving the data.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/bplustree.png" src="_images/bplustree.png"/>
<p>I have been working on a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B+tree">B+Tree</a> representation of the Estoria de
Espanna project data to provide search and a fast web frontend, these
can be read directly from the data files.</p>
<p>A fast web server like Nginx throwing out static files combined with
B+tree index for searches is pretty much unbeatable in terms of
performance. It is also pretty future proof - stupid lasts longer than
clever! The importance of this cannot be overstated in externally
funded projects that exist for their period of project funding and
then afterwards are maintained on a while-we-can basis.</p>
<p>Also, I am hoping to produce native mobile applications as part of the
Estoria project output, compiling an abridged version of the data
files directly into the app is far easier and has far better
performance than trying to port web application code to a phone by
statically linking in a Python interpreter.</p>

communities probably have their own strong ideas, but this is

            <h1><a href="2014/05/28/modern_mounting_with_udisks2.html">Modern Mounting with Udisks2</a></h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/mounted.jpg" src="_images/mounted.jpg"/>
<p>In this post we look at the changes in disk mounting and then look at
the udisksctl command which allows you to automount disks from the
command line. Feel free to skip past the background info if you just
want to learn how to use the command.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the beginning (Thursday, 1 January 1970?) to add a storage device
(such as a hard disk) to a computer was an infrequent affair, and
required the machine to be turned off.</p>
<p>So the classic system of disk mounting on a Posix (‘Unix-like’) system
was for the system administrator to list all the disks in a plain text
file systems table, which on most systems can be found in the file
/etc/fstab.</p>
<p>Nowadays servers often have the ability to add and remove disks
without turning the machine off. Even in desktop computers, SATA
drives have this facility too at least according to the SATA drive -
but it depends a lot on the manufacturer of motherboard controller
actually following the standard so it is not usually worth the risk.</p>
<p>The main thing that has really brought hotplugging into use is
external disks such as USB drives and other trendy connectors that
come and (mostly) go such as Firewire, eSata, Thunderbolt, etc.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/duck.jpg" src="_images/duck.jpg"/>
<p>In the early 2000s, the first attempt to cope with this was called
HAL - Hardware Abstraction Layer, which did what it said on the tin,
provided a layer between device nodes and the user of the nodes, so
storage devices (and other hardware) can be added and removed without
rebooting this system and without rewriting the /etc/fstab file.</p>
<p>Then everything gets replaced a dizzying number of times (DeviceKit,
devfs, etc) as better approaches are discovered in a fast moving
period of hardware development, udev eventually won and was the main
thing for the rest of the decade.</p>
<p>When a device is added or removed from the system, the Linux kernel
notices and sends out an event. Udev is a daemon that waits around
listening for these events and then responding accordingly. udev runs
in user space not kernel space which is good for security as you
cannot plug in a USB stick and take over the kernel like on some
proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>In 2012, the <a class="reference external" href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.hotplug.devel/17392">udev project merged</a> into the systemd project; systemd is
the next generation (or current generation for some distributions)
system and service manager. Systemd is really cool and is being
adopted by most of the major distributions but it is still a year or
two away in some cases depending on their release cycles.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that if you want to control disks on the command
line and you are using the mount command you are 20 years out of
date. Enough history, lets get to the flesh.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/usb.jpg" src="_images/usb.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-line-usage">
<h2>Command Line Usage</h2>
<p>When you hot plug disks in the system, the graphical interface
automatically reacts and provides buttons to mount, unmount and so
on. However, if you have accessed a machine remotely, or just like to
use the command line, then this post will tell you how to use the same
automounting approach as the GUI.</p>
<p>For a system controlled by udev (or systemd), one command line tool is
called udisks. It has two versions, in the original version 1, the
command is udisks, for the second version udisks2, it is udisksctl.</p>
<p>If you don’t have these commands already installed then you will have
to install the udisks2 or udisks packages. In the case of the Debian
distribution, udisks is in Wheezy and udisks2 is in Jessie. I seem to
have both installed for some reason, possibly because I started at
Wheezy and upgraded to Jessie.</p>
<p>Anyway, we will look at the newest one, udisksctl.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="udisksctl">
<h2>udisksctl</h2>
<p>The main commands follow, there are several more that can be seen with:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl <span class="nb">help</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see a list of disks attached to the system:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl status
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For a very in depth list of disk information:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl dump
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To mount a filesystem:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You don’t need to give a location, it will sort that out automatically
for you. On my system it mounts the disk at /media/username/label
where username is obviously your username and label is the label of
the disk partition, other distributions may deal with it differently.</p>
<p>To unmount a filesystem:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdb1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the command is unmount with an N, not umount like the
classic command.</p>
<p>Note that these command names autocomplete which is kinda cool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="udisks">
<h2>udisks</h2>
<p>The old udisks command is pretty similar except instead of giving a command
name, you give an argument, e.g. to get the full disk information:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>udisks --dump
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Instead of status, it has –enumerate. This option lists partitions instead
of physical disks like in the newer udisksctl.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="go-forth-and-mount">
<h2>Go forth and mount</h2>
<p>So udisksctl is pretty cool, we can now mount and unmount disks from
the command line in the same way as the GUI. Do remember that the disk
information from the udisksctl dump command can quite be useful when
wanting to know about the disks attached to a system.</p>

            <h1><a href="2014/05/27/python_long_type.html">Python’s Disappearing Long Type</a></h1>
<img alt="../../../_images/robotspider.png" src="_images/robotspider.png"/>
<p><em>Note: everything below refers to the default (missionary position) C
implementation of Python.</em></p>
<p>If you are converting Python code from Python 2 to Python 3, you might
notice that the conversion tool transforms any uses of <em>long()</em> into
<em>int()</em>. If that confuses you, this post will hopefully make it clear.</p>
<p>Before Python 2.2, there was a clear distinction between two of the
Python numerical types, the <em>int</em> type and the Python <em>long</em> type.</p>
<p>Firstly, Python’s <em>int</em> type was implemented as a signed long. So a Python
<em>int</em> takes 32 bits of memory, which while not as efficient as some
really optimised approach using shorter types, is still very fast
indeed.</p>
<p>Secondly, Python’s <em>long</em> type is an integer of unlimited size (well until you
run of RAM - which would be an unrealistically massive number not
useful for anything).</p>
<p>Python’s <em>long</em> type does not map directly to a C type, it is a custom
type implemented in the Python source code somewhere which I guess
uses a C struct or whatever. As you might imagine, using the Python
<em>long</em> type is significantly more RAM intensive and slower than the Python
<em>int</em> type, but in reality it is rarely a problem (see below).</p>
<p>Hans Fangohr <a class="reference external" href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/blog/performance-of-pythons-long-data-type.html">did a little performance testing</a> and found that
Python’s long type is about three times slower than the Python’s <em>int</em>
type.</p>
<p>Unified <em>ints</em> were <a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0237/">brought in for Python 2.2</a>. This starts off as a
Python <em>int</em> but transforms magically to a Python <em>long</em> if it needs
to. Here is how it works in Python 2.2 to 2.7:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775807</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775808L</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'long'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">long</span>
<span class="go">&lt;type 'long'&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that when we add 1 to sys.maxsize, the result has an L suffix to
denote it is a Python <em>long</em> and no longer a 32 bit number.</p>
<p>In Python 3, it works in a similar the way, however the fact you are
no longer using a 32 bit type is now completely hidden away from the
user:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775807</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="go">9223372036854775808</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">maxsize</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class 'int'&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">long</span>
<span class="gt">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span class="nb">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="m">1</span>, in <span class="n">&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span class="gr">NameError</span>: <span class="n">name 'long' is not defined</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This time, when we add 1 to sys.maxsize, the result has no L suffix;
trying to call the long constructor function causes an exception
because it does not exist anymore in Python 3.</p>
<p>Of course, the fun of Python is that being a high level language, we
normally don’t really care as long a we get a number; this is it
rightly got changed it to be one unified type.</p>
<p>One might design a high performance application not to use the Python
<em>long</em> type if it turns out to be a bottleneck. However, normally you
would have other bigger insurmountable bottlenecks in your
software/hardware/network stack so you don’t care about this.</p>
<p>However, if you are working on a multi-language project, especially if
you are using Python alongside a lower level language like C, then it
is useful to know what is going on underneath the Python types.</p>
<p>The Python float type is implemented as a C double. This doesn’t
change across versions. Several other numeric types are available in
Python of course.</p>
<p>So if you see <em>long</em> being converted to <em>int</em> by the 2to3 conversion
tool, now you know why.</p>

<h2>Denarius</h2>
<p>Wars are often an unexpected event, and a lot of the major currency
developments in the 19th and 20th centuries were due to wars. In the
ancient world it was no different. The requirement to quickly gather
resources required an efficient form of money.</p>
<p>During the Second Punic War, in 211 BC, Rome brought out the Denarius,
which means ‘containing ten’ - because one silver Denarius was worth
ten bronze (later copper) Asses.</p>
<p>During the Third Punic war, in 140 BC, Rome decided to go hexadecimal,
where one silver-coloured Denarius became worth 16 copper Asses.</p>
<p>The silver-coloured Denarius was considered a day’s wages for a
soldier. The gold-coloured Solidus varied in value but eventually
stabilised by the 8th century as 12 denarii.</p>
<p>The Romans carried spread currency around and in Britain, the denarius
became the penny but was still written as d until 1971 e.g. 5d for 5
pence.</p>
<p>12d made a shilling, which is the Anglo-Saxon term for the
Solidus. The shilling was in the 16th century pegged to the value of a
cow in Kent market.</p>
<p>Twenty shilling made a pound which was named after the unit of mass, a
pound in cash was originally worth the value of a pound weight of silver
(which is now about £300).</p>
<p>The pound of a unit of mass is itself Roman of course, from libra,
which is why pound is shortened to lb. The pound £ sign was originally
an L. 1 lb in mass is 16 ounces.</p>
<p>Part the deal when Britain applied to join the European Economic
Community in the 1960s and 1970s, was that we got rid of all these
crazy measurements and adopted metric, also known as scientific
measurements, which we did eventually, to a certain extent. For
example, milk, beer and cider are officially sold in units of 568 mL!</p>
<p>So until recently, the idea of non-base 10 measurements was completely
normal.</p>

<p>The core idea that all knowledge and thought could be reduced to two
factors nothing (0) and God (1), had long been discussed, for example
by the the Jesuit Gottfried Leibniz writing in the 17th
Century. However, Boole had the mathematical knowledge to take the
idea and build a complete system of logic around it.</p>

<p>Now it is easy to convert any binary number to hex. You just split it
up into nibbles from the right.</p>
<p>So this number:</p>
<p>11111011110</p>
<p>Split up is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="mi">0111</span> <span class="mi">1101</span> <span class="mi">1110</span>
  <span class="mi">7</span>    <span class="n">d</span>    <span class="n">e</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So in hex it is 7de.</p>
<p>What number is it in decimal? Well that is more complicated. Going
from binary to decimal requires you to split the binary number up into
parts:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>10000000000 1024
1000000000   512
100000000    256
10000000     128
1000000       64
10000         16
1000           8
100            4
10             2

1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = ?
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So data is electrical impulses in a transistor, which represent 1 and
0, which are then hexadecimal numbers.</p>
<p>Now we have numbers, we can now encode characters. Each character is given a hex number.</p>
<p>So 41 in hex (which is 65 in decimal) is “latin capital letter A”.</p>
<p>There are different encodings (mapping between numbers and characters)
but the only one that really matters in 2014 is called UTF-8 commonly
called Unicode (although there are other forms of Unicode which did
not win).</p>
<p>UTF-8 has room for 1,112,064 different characters and symbols which
aim to represent all of the world’s languages.</p>
<p>The first 128 characters are carried over from an older standard
called ASCII. The first 32 of these are historic control characters
for controlling printers and teletype devices (remember those from a
previous lecture?).</p>
<p>20 in hex (so 32 in decimal) is the empty space, then we get
punctuation, then we get the numbers and so more punctuation etc then
the letters in upper case then some more symbols then the letters in
lower case etc.</p>
<p>This gets us to 7E (126) which is ~, and we have all of the English
keyboard covered. The next 129 characters are Western European
languages (German etc) and then it carries on after that through all
the world’s letters and symbols.</p>
<p>Including some really fun stuff added to give compatibility with
Japanese mobile phones:</p>

<p>So a digital text is a series of these hexadecimal numbers representing
characters and symbols including spaces (20 in hex/32 in decimal) and
control codes such as line breaks (0A in hex, 10 in decimal) and so
on.</p>
<p>Here is a nice chart version of the first 127 (ASCII) characters:
<a class="reference external" href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html">http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html</a></p>
<p>So you can decode these characters (with some spaces added to make it
simpler):</p>
<p>41 6e 64 20 74 68 65 72 65 66 6f 72 65 20 6e 65 76 65 72 20 73 65 6e
64 20 74 6f 20 6b 6e 6f 77 20 66 6f 72 20 77 68 6f 6d 20 74 68 65 20
62 65 6c 6c 20 74 6f 6c 6c 73 3b 20 49 74 20 74 6f 6c 6c 73 20 66 6f
72 20 74 68 65 65 2e</p>
<p>To make it clear that something is a hex value, it is often prefixed
with 0x or x or U+.</p>
<p>This is as good as it far as it goes. But to make practical use of the
data, just loads of text doesn’t help that much.</p>
<p>If we want to make a digital representation of a humanities artefact
like a manuscript, we need to use a file format. Otherwise the digital
text is of limited use for other scholars and software.</p>

<h2>Why not use a word processor?</h2>
<p>A word processor is an approximation of a late 19th century typewriter. A word processor will not help in transcribing this:</p>

<p>How about this:</p>

<p>In the 1980s and onwards, a group of humanities scholars created the
TEI, which is a set of guidelines for digitally representing
humanities data:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">These</span> <span class="n">Guidelines</span> <span class="n">apply</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">texts</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">any</span> <span class="n">natural</span> <span class="n">language</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="nb">any</span> <span class="n">date</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">any</span> <span class="n">literary</span> <span class="n">genre</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">text</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">without</span> <span class="n">restriction</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">form</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">content</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The guidelines can be found online here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/">http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/</a></p>
<p>The TEI was initially SGML based then became XML based. What this
means is that the text of the artefact is typed up, and meaning and extra information is inserted into the text using angle brackets.</p>
<p>An example of a text encoded using the TEI format:
<a class="reference external" href="http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/718/1/47.xml">http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/718/1/47.xml</a></p>
<p>So in this simple line here:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">w</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"6"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">testimonium</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The element &lt;w&gt; which means word, has an attribute n with value 6
which quite obviously tells us that it is word number 6. The text of
the word then follows, and then the word ends with a closing tag: &lt;/w&gt;</p>
<p>As explained in the preface to the TEI guidelines, part of the reason
for them was to enable sharing of data and a new generation of shared
TEI-supporting software to emerge.</p>
<p>Sadly that never really happened. The problem with the TEI is that it
is a huge standard that doesn’t really simplify the problem space in
any way. There are hundreds of available elements and every author of
a TEI document uses their own subset it in his/her own way.</p>
<p>Churchill famously said that “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”</p>
<p>TEI is the worst form of encoding, except for all the other forms that have been tried from time to time.</p>
