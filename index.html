<img alt="../../../_images/ecj.png" src="_images/ecj.png"/>
<p>The EU’s position paper called <a class="reference external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/essential-principles-citizens-rights_en_0.pdf">Essential Principles on Citizens’ Rights</a>
demands, among other things, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The Commission should have full powers for the monitoring and the
Court of Justice of the European Union should have full jurisdiction
corresponding to the duration of the protection of citizen’s rights in
the Withdrawal agreement.</div></blockquote>
<p>If the ECJ can be an mediator in every interaction the UK government
or a company has with an EU citizen, then we will still have no
ability to fix any of the pressing issues facing this country,
including the still unresolved causes of the 2008 crash. Every
government policy has winners and losers. Every bad policy has some
corner-case where someone benefits from it.</p>
<p>With 3 million or more EU citizens, any issue can be turned into an
issue affecting an EU citizen providing forum shopping and then the EU
law will apply.</p>
<p>The idea of everyone being equal before the common law and that UK
judges are trusted to apply it is anathema to the EU’s Napoleonic
position that only the ECJ can be trusted to protect EU citizens.</p>
<p>This is really a “special interest”/“closed shop” self serving
argument, if national courts can be trusted, there is no point to the
EU. To protect its own need to exist, the EU has to insert itself into
everything, even if it is not needed.</p>
<p>The US Supreme Court doesn’t need to interfere if an American citizen
resident in the UK has a problem with a public institution or company,
that American just uses the normal UK courts to plead their case.</p>
<p>The UK has residents who hail from the whole world including millions
of citizens from the other 169 countries in the world that are not in
the EU. They manage quite fine to use the existing UK Courts. They
don’t need their legal systems to intervene in British law.</p>
<p>Note there is no reciprocal right in the proposal for British citizens
living in the EU to call for assistance from the British courts.</p>
<p>This whole lop-sided proposal shows how the Euro-federalists see the
UK as a difficult colony, not as an independent country or let alone
as an equal partner.</p>
<p>Staying under the law of the EU is not Brexit, we would have just
moved from a colony with very little say of how we are governed to a
colony with no say over how we are governed.</p>
<p>It is not the independent country that people voted for.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/longlive.png" src="_images/longlive.png"/>
<p>For those reading later, Facebook was an early 21st Century “Social
Network”, it was web application that you can sign up to and share
text and pictures with other users.</p>
<div class="section" id="tangent-on-why-i-don-t-use-facebook">
<h2>1. Tangent on why I don’t use Facebook</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/scrabble.png" src="_images/scrabble.png"/>
<p>I was at University when Facebook started so I got an early invite
when it was a University based system. I quit in 2006 when it became
available to the whole public and stopped being connected to the
physical campus. I am not some kind of elitist, it just lost any
meaning to me at that point. I am surprised it is still going a whole
decade later.</p>
<p>There are no real barriers to talk any of my old school friends, many
have parents still living in the same place as my parents and moving
in the same circles as my parents but for whatever reason we didn’t
bother keeping up.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was being collected by such people in the race to get more
‘friends’ and was being distracted with requests to play scrabble and
vote on things and so on.</p>
<p>Many normal people seem to have taken on this horrific American
practice of presenting a horribly bland PR-style over-positive view of
yourself. Everyone on Facebook is Hyacinth Bucket from Keeping Up
Appearances.</p>
<p>Unless, like Pheidippides, you brought important news about how you have
defeated the Persians and then died on the finish line, I don’t really
care about the marathons you are training for.</p>
<p>Unless you are sending me a slice, I don’t care about the cake you
made. Unless you have wired it up as an IoT project, I really don’t
care about your cat.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-the-web-to-the-mesh">
<h2>2. From the Web to the Mesh</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/cyborg_cheshire_cat.png" src="_images/cyborg_cheshire_cat.png"/>
<p>For those in the military and Universities, we made our own
networks. To provide internet to homes and businesses, commercial ISPs
moved in.</p>
<p>This however was not the only possible model. Before BT was
privatised, it had its own plan to provide a national data network to
be run by the post office.</p>
<p>Since then, hundreds of municipal wireless networks have been
setup. Wikipedia <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_wireless_network">maintains a big list</a>.</p>
<p>Rather more interestingly, there are many attempts to get away from
the centralised, corporate/government controlled Internet altogether.</p>
<p>Remove the ISPs, the DNS, etc and just depend on distributed Mesh
Networks where every node has everything required to fully connect to
the other nodes. This is a mathematically superior approach which in
the end will require a lot less electricity, bureaucracy and cost.</p>
<p>However, when all nodes are equal, there is not any obvious point
where organisations like the CIA or GCHQ can stick themselves as a man
in the middle, and there is little ability for the government to
censor or cut anyone off using easy digital means.</p>
<p>But it is fine. It is too expensive to make water pipes care if you
use the water for drinking, cleaning your car or for water boarding a
terrorist suspect.</p>
<p>It is not economic to replace the roads with special surfaces that
turn to mud if a bank robber is performing a getaway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-still-miss-gopher">
<h2>3. I still miss Gopher</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/noise.png" src="_images/noise.png"/>
<p>In 1991, the leading Internet content protocol was Gopher. It had
automatic client-side formatting and strong typing of content files,
removing many security problems that WWW faced.</p>
<p>It was also easy for anyone to add to gopherspace, you didn’t need
coding or graphic skills.</p>
<p>However, WWW was completely public domain so won, despite its
technological shortcomings. By 2017, we have lots of tools like
markdown, bootstrap, Jekyll/Sphinx etc which mean you don’t have to
put a lot of work into making a readable website.</p>
<p>This blog is statically generated using Sphinx and there is no
serverside code. I am paying absolutely nothing for you to read this.</p>
<p>It is getting easier all the time, but it is still not as easy as it
should be to add your own content to WWW.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social-networks-suck">
<h2>4. Social Networks Suck</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/facebook.png" src="_images/facebook.png"/>
<p>To bridge this easy to read/hard to write gap, the social networks
jumped in. These are easy for people to quickly post their cat photos
and show off.</p>
<p>The concept ‘net neutrality’ describes how the WWW is (supposed to be)
broadly content indifferent, it is just a pipe to push information
through. Mesh networks described above take this concept even further.</p>
<p>Social networks are a downgrade from WWW, in that now content is
inside silos that are centrally controlled by a private company with
no requirement to enforce freedom of speech.</p>
<p>James Delingpole <a class="reference external" href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/03/17/delingpole-facebook-banned-me-for-defending-milo/">wrote an article about his problems</a> being a
centrist/conservative journalist and media personality using West
Coast controlled social networks to promote his work:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For some of you this won’t matter because Facebook. You think Mark
Zuckerberg is a weird sociopath, that it’s a cesspit of festering
left-liberalism, that social media is a waste of time. Yes I get
that - but you don’t work in the media, whereas I do and for all
of us in the communications industry whether we’re writers,
entertainers, journalists, bloggers, vloggers or podcasters
Facebook is a big deal because so much of our audience is on
it. And it’s as important to those of us on the right as it is on
the left.</div></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a lot of work.</p>
<p>James Delingpole has a nice podcast, if his content is good enough,
his fans will share it, it doesn’t matter if he is on Facebook
himself.</p>
<p>I am probably too old for Milo, but I notice that every time Milo does
something, it still appears on Twitter, despite Milo being banned,
because his limitless undergraduate fans share it.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I used to play MUD games and even wrote one once. One
famous MUD had inside its introductory help file, something like
“don’t base your life on a game you don’t control and can be banned
from.”</p>
<p>Kind of why I stopped playing MUDs, when you find a MUD that doesn’t
ban you, they tend to put you in charge. You cannot really play in
peace as a casual player, even if you try to, someone will redesign
the world half way through and negate all the time you put into
building a character.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/bond.png" src="_images/bond.png"/>
<p>Another way of putting it is James is like an Ambassador to the USSR.</p>
<p>An Ambassador to a hostile country should always know they are on
borrowed time. At any time the host country can revoke the credentials
and force a replacement.</p>
<p>Maybe the Ambassador did something wrong, maybe not, maybe they were
just too effective or were not able to be turned.</p>
<p>The Ambassador shouldn’t go native and base his life on being able to
stay.</p>
<p>To take a different analogy, Western bishops used diplomatic charm to
try to protect Russian Christians from being killed by the Atheist
USSR.</p>
<p>No doubt useful work but appeasement and trying to fix the USSR wasn’t
what won the cold war.</p>
<p>It was consumer goods, making the free world demonstrably better for
ordinary people, this is what brought down the USSR.</p>
<p>Facebook is a totalitarian state, some people thrive there but
generally, it is better to get out while you can.</p>
<p>The semi-free world is the WWW, the really free world is the Mesh, the
darknet, peer-to-peer networks and Tor.</p>
<p>If possible, I want to build up the free world but it will happen
anyway if it is meant to. Technology may or not be imbibed with a
spirit, but it seems to have an inevitability about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jesus-vs-pontius-pilate">
<h2>5. Jesus Vs Pontius Pilate</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/net.png" src="_images/net.png"/>
<p>Pontius Pilate served as governor of Judaea then retired to his villa
in Rome. Did he even remember executing Jesus? To him it would have
seemed like one of many local disputes he dealt with. Being a colonial
overlord was known to be a hard gig.</p>
<p>Pilate got a lot of bad PR, being the baddy of the Easter story but
that was later. Pilate was most probably already dead long before
Christianity spread far enough for Rome to notice it.</p>
<p>Jesus got tortured and executed then got a billion followers and a
seat at the right hand of God, but no villa.</p>
<p>Jesus had two friends named James, his brother and James, son of
Zebedee. One was thrown off the temple and/or stoned to death, the
other had his head cut off with a sword (Acts 12:1-2). James does have
a cathedral built over where his head was buried but he didn’t get a
villa either.</p>
<p>It is one thing to get millions or billion of followers, it is another
thing to keep your head on your shoulders as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-silent-majority">
<h2>6. The silent majority</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/quiet.png" src="_images/quiet.png"/>
<p>I never really felt like being a Jesus figure. Most people don’t, I
talked a lot about the <a class="reference external" href="http://zeth.net/2016/08/02/let_them_eat_cake.html">silent majority</a> before.</p>
<p>The loudest people in tech are from the West Coast of the
USA. Meanwhile, software developers and professors working within
Universities can go native and be as left wing as the other
professors.</p>
<p>However, the vast majority of developers are like the majority of most
other people, just in the centre.</p>
<p>The crazy far-left minority are just disproportionately loud. When
they bring their politics into a space or event not to do with
politics, people mostly just politely humour them and nod along while
looking at their watches or checking their phones.</p>
<p>No one breaks their bubble, people are keen not to prolong it any
further. They have organised childcare or transport and want to just
get on with fly-fishing or software development or whatever got them
to the event.</p>
<p>Those far-lefties without self awareness may take this to mean
everyone agrees, however this is a mistake, they are unprepared for
events like Brexit or Trump when the majority show they don’t really
care that much about their sacred cows.</p>
<p>Once all the centrist and the conservative speakers have been purged
from Facebook, the silent majority will just silently fade out as
their timeline gets boring and other things get invented that are more
interesting than pictures of cats.</p>
<p>VR, IoT, the Mesh’s first killer app, whatever. There is always
something new.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-is-progress">
<h2>7. Technology is progress</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/mesh.png" src="_images/mesh.png"/>
<p>A lot of the crazy left today is anti-technological. It is mathematics
that will save the world not socialism or “Intersectionality”.</p>
<p>The famous book by Kernighan and Ritchie (K&amp;R) has done more to
progress humanity than Marx’s Communist Manifesto.</p>
<p>As I expressed in parts 14 and 15 of <a class="reference external" href="http://zeth.net/2017/02/13/deplorables_hysterics_maastricht_trump.html">my previous essay</a>: politics, as
expressed in parliament, is really not that important. It is just
dealing with the effects of technological change.</p>
<p>The character of Viktor Komarovsky in the famous Boris Pasternak novel
Doctor Zhivago is a businessman or fixer who works with and benefits
from the aristocracy. When Communism takes over, he carries on in the
same role just with new clients.</p>
<p>Over the Twentieth Century, politics and culture have lurched back and
forth from free market capitalism to socialism to this current
corporatism and now we may be going back to capitalism.</p>
<p>However, software has just pressed on. From Turing through to K&amp;R to
Linus Torvalds and so on, we are in a line. Moore’s law, the compiler,
the web, robotics, AI, the singularity. No one can stop us.</p>

<p>2016 led to a clear divide between the Deplorables and the
Hysterics. Where did this come from?  What is the historical context
of Brexit? What should we in the UK make of President Trump? What role
did technology play in making this division?</p>
<p>This is another long read typed at the speed of thought, as always,
corrections and improvements are appreciated.</p>
<div class="section" id="where-to-begin">
<h2>1. Where to begin</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/deplorable.jpg" src="_images/deplorable.jpg"/>
<p>In my first essay on Brexit, <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs The Matrix</a>, I started at the last
Ice Age and went through each of the attempts to include Britain in a
United Europe project. This post will be somewhat more modern.</p>
<p>The 1975 referendum was a Labour affair, the pro-EU yes campaign led
by Harold Wilson and the No campaign led by the great Tony Benn.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/benn.jpg" src="_images/benn.jpg"/>
<p>In 1975, Benn and the leavers were accused of wanting to turn the UK
into an island of socialist utopia, it is not so relevant to this
current hysteria.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will start my story at 1992, for in retrospect, this is
where the Leave campaign began its march to successfully winning a
referendum on leaving the EU in 2016.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maastricht-rebels-the-battle-of-the-bastards">
<h2>1. Maastricht Rebels - the battle of the bastards</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/rebels.jpg" src="_images/rebels.jpg"/>
<p>One of the reasons that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s long and
electorally successful leadership was challenged by her own party was
her resistance to further European integration.</p>
<p>Under her more successor, John Mayor, the 1992 Maastricht Treaty was
negotiated. This converted the European Community to the European
Union, including European Economic and Monetary Union (the Euro being
finally set up on in 1 January 1999), but also lots of other areas of
policy being handed over to the European level.</p>
<p>This was not popular in the British parliament. Ratification was not
easy or quick and took another 18 months. A vote on one wrecking
amendment was tied 317-317 and only defeated because of the 1876
convention of the speaker breaking ties by voting no.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major famously called three members of his cabinet
(Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo), the “bastards” -
which was a still a controversial insult back in 1993.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while this Tory civil war was happening in Parliament, over
at the Bank of England and the Treasury, there was a different
European problem.</p>
<p>The inability to find an interest rate that would fit both Germany and
the UK led to a run on the pound and consequently the UK being ejected
from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday, further
pushing the UK away from Europe.</p>
<p>The combination of Black Wednesday, the way Thatcher was deposed and
the way Prime Minister John Major ruthlessly pushed the Maastricht
Treaty through parliament, splintered his party and the wider
conservative movement, and now in retrospect, sowed the inevitable
seeds of Brexit.</p>
<p>The elite MPs in control of the party machine had become de-anchored
from the mass of the Conservative party membership and the general
public. This led to a landslide defeat at the 1997 election and 13
years out of power.</p>
<p>However, those anti-EU forces created in the Maastricht ratification
process continued in the background.</p>
<p>Some of the leading 1992 rebels are still in parliament, for example,
Sir Bill Cash. While some of the younger ones, such as Dr Liam Fox and
Iain Duncan Smith, became the backbone of the Leave campaign.</p>
<p>Outside of the Tories, UKIP was began in response to the Maastricht
Treaty, it came into being between 1991 and 1993. On the day John
Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, an up and coming 27 year
-old conservative called Nigel Farage quit the Tories and became
UKIP’s first nationally recognised leader.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-great-euro-non-debate">
<h2>2. The great Euro non-debate</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/yah.jpg" src="_images/yah.jpg"/>
<p>By 1996, Britain’s place in Europe was not clear, with the Tory
members and much of the public wanting less Europe, while the pro-EU
John Major and big business wanting the UK to join the Euro in time
for its launch in 1999.</p>
<p>For ten years between 1995-ish to 2005-ish, there were two
competing campaigns on the Euro.</p>
<p>There was the campaign, financed by big business, for Britain to join
the Euro, with prophesies of doom and irrelevance if the UK didn’t join.</p>
<p>This culminated in the group Britain in Europe led by Tony Blair (in
theory but unwilling to expend political capital on it), Gordon Brown
(in theory but in practice going the other way, as we shall see below)
as well Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Charles Kennedy and so on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side, the was No Campaign primarily backed
by Sir Tim Rice of musical theatre fame and supported by all the
“bastards” from part 1 above.</p>
<p>All this preparation by the two campaigns happened in a kind of
political-geek parallel universe, it never bothered the general
public. Eventually, the money ran out and the two campaigns faded out
before they really started but it was a practice run for 2016 when
many of the same characters and same old arguments would re-emerge.</p>

<h2>3. Things can only get better</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/balls.jpg" src="_images/balls.jpg"/>
<p>In the 1997 election, Labour outflanked the pro-EU John Major by pushing
the Euro question into the long grass, with the famous <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_economic_tests">five Economic
Tests</a>, reportedly invented by Ed Balls in the back of a New
York taxi.</p>
<p>A work of electoral genius, Labour now had defused its own European
divisions with this technocratic measure. Those against further
integration could see the tests were not currently met and could hold
faith that convergence would never happen, while those in favour of
further integration could hold faith that convergence would naturally
occur and the tests would one day be met.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the UK and Eurozone economies diverged and the
prospect of the UK joining the Euro stopped becoming a realistic
option to anyone but the most extreme Euro-federalists, a rare breed
in the UK.</p>
<p>The UK entered the 2008 financial crisis with more dodgy banks and a
bigger national deficit than most of the Eurozone, including Southern
Europe.</p>
<p>However, the UK having an independent currency acted as an automatic
stabiliser and the UK made it through the crisis relatively unscathed
in the short term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those in Southern Europe, lumbered with an unsuitably
strong currency, suffered immeasurably more, proving the UK had dodged
a bullet. The economic situation of Greece is what the alternative
future of the UK could have been had we adopted the Euro currency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="big-business-credibility-problem">
<h2>4. Big business credibility problem</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/apocalypse.jpg" src="_images/apocalypse.jpg"/>
<p>The abortive pro-Euro campaign was led by big business such as the
City of London banks, Lord Sainsbury and so on, as well as the
international institutions and think tanks. The exact same people and
organisations that came back in the Remain Campaign of 2016. Not
entirely, some like James Dyson and JCB had moved to the Leave
campaign.</p>
<p>A lot of the “project fear”-type arguments had been made in the late
1990s and early 2000s about staying out of the Euro. However, the
reality of the financial crisis had proved them all wrong, not
entering the Euro had saved the UK.</p>
<p>The credibility problem of the UK pro-European campaigners was pretty
clear to anyone with eyes to see in the outcome of the UK financial
crisis.</p>
<p>Those against the EU since 1992 had been largely winning on democratic
and legal grounds but losing the economic argument. However, in the
aftermath of the financial crisis, the economic argument for the EU as
an economic magic bullet was becoming increasingly untenable as the UK
economy recovered steadily while the populations of many Eurozone
countries were being collectively punished with mass unemployment in
order to keep their economies within the Euro.</p>
<p>This is the background to the later Michael Gove style argument, why
trust these people and groups when they always get their predictions
wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lisbon-loons">
<h2>5. Lisbon Loons</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/harley_quinn.png" src="_images/harley_quinn.png"/>
<p>The 2010 Conservative manifesto was called
“<a class="reference external" href="https://www.conservatives.com/~/media/Files/Manifesto2010">Invitation to join the government of Britain</a>” (PDF)
and on pages 113 to 114 (pdf page number 124-125), promised a
referendum before handing over any more
powers to Europe.</p>
<p>However, when it came to the Lisbon Treaty, David Cameron weaseled out
and said the promise would apply to every treaty <em>after</em> the Lisbon
Treaty.</p>
<p>The Lisbon treaty was a massive step forward in the federalisation of
Europe and the last major treaty likely to be approved for a long
time, so Cameron’s promise turned out to be worthless (like all his
other promises).</p>
<p>Some Tory MPs tried to honour the promise anyway, here we quote a
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/18/david-cameron-ally-activists-loons">2013 Guardian Article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The senior Tory made the remarks - in earshot of journalists - after
being asked about the decision of 116 Tory MPs to defy the prime
minister and vote in favour of an amendment regretting the absence of
a EU referendum in the Queen’s speech.</p>
<p>The Conservative said: “It’s fine. There’s really no problem. The MPs
just have to do it because the associations tell them to, and the
associations are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Major called his rebel MP bastards, the Cameron set now considered the
largely Eurosceptic rank and file to be “mad, swivel-eyed
loons”. Cameron had the coalition with the Liberal Democrats to
average out the Eurosceptism of the Tory membership.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cameron-in-a-corner">
<h2>6. Cameron in a corner</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/cameron.png" src="_images/cameron.png"/>
<p>Cameron entered the 2015 election with a promise to renegotiate its
relationship with Europe and put that to an in/out
referendum - page 72 (PDF page 74) of the <a class="reference external" href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf">2015 manifesto</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>How this was supposed to work in David’s Cameron’s mind probably
involved the context of a coalition with the Lib Dems.</p>
<p>In the months before the 2015 election, the media has factored in an
Ed Miliband victory or at least the unpopular David Cameron would be
scrabbling around for a coalition with the Lib Dems who might be
smaller but still significant.</p>
<p>Instead, the Tories won an outright majority, not least because the
referendum pledge re-united the grassroots behind the government
rather than UKIP. Cameron came back into power in 2015 with a party
more Eurosceptic than ever.</p>
<p>The most pro-EU party, the Lib Dems went from 57 seats to 8 seats,
i.e. an 86% loss.</p>
<p>While many MPs were loyal to David Cameron in the referendum, they
were answerable to extremely Euro-sceptic local parties, and
constituencies that were increasingly Eurosceptic too.</p>
<p>In the manifesto, David Cameron had promised to hold the referendum by
the end of 2017, however pretty much the day after the 7th May 2015
election, Britain’s place in the EU became the hot topic to the
exclusion of everything else.</p>
<p>Almost a year later, in April 2016, I remember thinking then that
pretty much every argument that could be made, had been made. Luckily,
David Cameron set the date of the vote to the 23rd June.</p>
<p>On the 24th of June, I was like phew, finally we can talk about
something else but Britain leaving Europe, but no, the losing side
didn’t disarm but carried on campaigning. We still are drowning in
this one issue. Anyway I am getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Why did Cameron hold the vote earlier than needed? Did he believe it
the European issue was preventing progress on any other issue? Did he
believe he had it in the bag? Did he want a successful remain vote to
be his legacy act before leaving the stage?</p>
<p>Perhaps his hand was forced by Merkel and Hollande, not wanting the UK
relationship to become an issue in the 2017 French and German
elections (well they failed there).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-campaign">
<h2>7. The campaign</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/twilight.png" src="_images/twilight.png"/>
<p>I have talked a lot about the campaign and why leave won and the
mistakes made by remain. Remain didn’t put their best arguments
first. Remain didn’t update their arguments to take account of
the 2008 financial crisis and the situation in Greece.</p>
<p>The Leave campaign had seen all the remain arguments coming from 15
years before and were ready for them.</p>
<p>I have covered the economic side in other posts and why Brexit didn’t
cause an immediate recession as promised by the project fear (which
had lost all credibility in the previous iteration 4 - The Gove
argument).</p>
<p>I could talk about a lot of things but want to focus one thing, namely
what those who wanted to leave were called by the remain campaigners.</p>
<p>Like “bastards” and “mad, swivel-eyed loons”, the elite hysterically
called the people names. I went back to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07gbrq9/question-time-09062016">9th June 2015 edition of
Question Time</a> (link will expire 12th June 2017) and made a list, in
this single program, leavers were called:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Economically illiterate</li>
<li>Manics that want to burn the economy</li>
<li>Little Englanders</li>
<li>Uneducated</li>
<li>Trying to cause third world war in Europe.</li>
<li>Liars</li>
<li>Nazis</li>
<li>Removing hope from the world</li>
<li>Causing the breakup of the United Kingdom</li>
<li>Want to cause a civil war in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This was just one episode of one program, we had months of it. Later
in the campaign it escalated to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Old people should not be allowed to vote</li>
<li>Leavers are all racists that caused the Murderer of Jo Cox and a wave of crime</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>My favourite was when President of the European Council <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/project-fear-turn-11-brexit-spell-end-western-civilisation-says-donald-tusk/">Donald Tusk said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>I fear that Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of
not only the EU but also of western political civilisation in its
entirety.</div></blockquote>
<p>If the remain campaigners were confident in their economic case, there
would not have needed to be this demonising of the leavers. It was an
act of desperation, a slow communal mental breakdown of the ruling
class, the delayed unwinding of the pre-2008 globalist consensus.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-people-are-not-bothered">
<h2>8. The people are not bothered</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/bothered.jpg" src="_images/bothered.jpg"/>
<p>Despite all that constant fear mongering and rhetoric by the elite,
52% of the UK voters bravely decided to leave anyway. According to the
pollsters Yougov and ICM, many more have joined the cause since the
vote.</p>
<p>The institutions and elites and dire apocalyptic warnings have become
like crying wolf, they have lost any credibility whatsoever, and just
makes those who make them distrusted.</p>
<p>The people have become shame-proof, moan proof. But they remember who
calls them names.</p>
<p>I think it is pretty hard to shame anyone into anything, it is not how
you win anything. You win by building the biggest coalition. Remain
could have possibly built a massive coalition but it didn’t want to,
it preferred to call people names, especially the working class and
the old.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-a-galaxy-far-far-away">
<h2>9. In a galaxy far far away</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/hobbits.jpg" src="_images/hobbits.jpg"/>
<p>Meanwhile on the other side of the pond something else was
stirring. In 2011, Republican Senator John McCain called the
Republican grassroots “<a class="reference external" href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/176055--mccain-not-sorry-for-tea-party-hobbits-comment">Tea Party Hobbits</a>“</p>
<p>In 2016, Hillary Clinton in her election campaign said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of
Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of
deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic,
Islamaphobic - you name it. And unfortunately there are people
like that. And he has lifted them up.</div></blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump had over 65 million votes. Any person with common sense
knows there is not over 30 million racists and sexists running around.</p>
<p>The situation is not 100% the same as the UK but it is comparable in
that it again demonising the population. I always thought Trump would
win the Republican primary but this speech was the moment that I knew
Hillary would lose.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-is-the-heck-is-trump-anyway">
<h2>10. Who is the heck is Trump anyway?</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/trump.png" src="_images/trump.png"/>
<p>The same people calling leavers names, the people with the repeated
credibility problems are now telling us that “Trump is literally
Hitler”.</p>
<p>The 52% had to become thick skinned already and are suspicious of the
elite media and institutions.</p>
<p>I was already slightly immune to this. For almost every US election in
my lifetime, the winning President has been called evil or invalid by
the losing side. It is all very hysterical until silly season ends and
life moves on to some issue of the day.</p>
<p>Reagan was called a second rate actor and conman, until he lead the
fight against the Soviet Union and was considered a hero.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton was derided as a socialist who was going to bring back
the USSR yet many agree Clinton managed the economy far better than
many of his predecessors and successors and kept America safe. It was
the end of a golden age which his two successors largely bungled and
threw away.</p>
<p>Piers Morgan said that Trump cannot be worse than George W. Bush who
lied about weapons of mass destruction to get us into a poorly planned
War in Iraq which led to a million civilian deaths and thousands of
American, British and other soldiers being killed and even more being
maimed.</p>
<p>I have a lot of sympathy for that statement.</p>
<p>Obama was derided as a Kenyan Muslim communist who would introduce
death panels to wipe out old people. It is all just hysteria every time.</p>
<p>The greatest American president in history is FDR who saved the world
from “literally Hitler” i.e. the actual Hitler.</p>
<p>Based on the limited amount of time that Trump has been in office,
perhaps he is somewhere between the extremes of W. Bush and FDR ... as in
no-one knows. Presidents rarely are remembered for how they started or
what they campaigned for; events happen and the narrative always
changes after the fact. Ask me in the year 2047 if Trump was good or
bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sex-is-not-our-business">
<h2>11. Sex is not our business</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/monica.jpg" src="_images/monica.jpg"/>
<p>When President Clinton, a 50 year-old married man, had relations with
a naïve and impressionable 22 year-old White House intern, he was
criticised domestically.</p>
<p>The UK has quite strong laws and policies on the abuse of a position
of trust so a UK politician doing exactly the same thing today would
not survive but given the Jimmy Savile revelations who knows what they
could get away with back then.</p>
<p>However, in general in the UK, we don’t care about our politicians’
sex lives. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>Most people would find it hard to pick many of our Prime Minister’s
spouses or children out in a crowd. We generally leave the spouses and
children out of the public limelight. We have the Royal Family for all
that.</p>
<p>Andrea Leadsom ended the referendum campaign as one of the winners, a
woman on the up, she was in the running to succeed David Cameron as
Prime Minister. When she was perceived, perhaps unfairly, to be
playing the motherhood card, the media threw it back in her face in
the most extreme way and her leadership bid came to a shuddering halt.</p>
<p>The position of the UK government on the Lewinsky scandal was that it
was none of our business. When asked about this Blair said the words
of Ruth (1:16):</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will
lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God”</div></blockquote>
<p>Blair was always over the top but here he was correct. The
transatlantic alliance between the US and UK is not about the
personality of the current leaders, it is a permanent alliance between
two peoples with the same language and many of the same values: common
law, freedom, the enlightenment, strong defence against our enemies,
democracy, rule of law and so on.</p>
<p>What is good for the Democrats is good for the Republicans, let’s not
worry what President Trump said to a friend on a bus in 2005. I really
don’t want to go down the route of making political capital out of our
politicians’ private lives.</p>
<p>As Jesus (may have) said, let him who is without sin cast the first
stone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-are-not-doing-a-merger">
<h2>12. We are not doing a merger</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/merger.png" src="_images/merger.png"/>
<p>The US and the UK have many differences, often determined by our
histories and geography.</p>
<p>America feared the Royal Navy would lead a surprise attack on the US and
topple the government, so militias were part of the national defence.</p>
<p>The UK doesn’t have a second amendment because we obviously don’t fear
the British invading, we never had a tradition of mass gun
ownership. When the British Bill of Rights talked about a right to
bear arms it meant pikes. Our traditional solution to national defence
was to fill the sea around us with ships and cannons.</p>
<p>During the existential struggle that was World War II, most of the UK
population worked in the military or for the state directly or
indirectly, everyone became used to getting healthcare and wanted to
keep it after the war.</p>
<p>Churchill opposed healthcare free at the point of use in 1945 and the
population kicked him out as Prime Minister, when he changed his mind,
the voters gave him his job back.</p>
<p>So in the UK, there is a seven decade national consensus behind free
at the point of use healthcare.</p>
<p>In the US, you get what you earn. It is the American way. The
successful and hard working get the best healthcare in the world and
the unlucky, the unsuccessful or lazy get pretty basic care or nothing.</p>
<p>In the UK, it is full on socialised medicine and it is a mean
average - everyone gets the same - rich or poor. We do have waiting
lists, we do ration. In a crunch, the system does put the needs of
children and working age people above the old.</p>
<p>New expensive treatments may not be initially available like in the
US. The NHS might sit on its hands and wait for the producer to reduce
the price or for a cheaper treatment to come available. Doctors won’t
do meaningless tests for the sake of making money. People that are not
sick or have minor things that can be self-treated, are told not to
bother wasting a doctor’s time.</p>
<p>The minority of rich people who don’t like it, generally move to
America and buy healthcare there. However, generally it works. The
user has almost no paperwork to fill out.</p>
<p>While we do have waiting lists, you get on with your normal life, when
you get to the appointed time, it is generally quite businesslike and
there is not a lot of waiting inside the hospital, except when it all
goes wrong because of staff shortages or planning foul ups, etc.</p>
<p>Gun control and healthcare and many other issues are domestic
policies. We do not need the UK and the US to be the same.</p>
<p>Some people in the UK criticise the wall and Trump’s policies on
border control. The UK is surrounded by rough, cold and unforgiving
seas on all sides, it is a little bit hypocritical for the UK to
criticise. In any case, it is for their own voters to decide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="allies-not-clones">
<h2>13. Allies not clones</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/ukus.jpg" src="_images/ukus.jpg"/>
<p>The important issue is how can the UK and US work together better to
our mutual benefit? I agree with our Prime Minister Theresa May. It
doesn’t matter if we in the UK love or hate many of Trump’s policies,
we can still work together. We should try to work with
everyone. Engagement is the British approach.</p>
<p>The UK has a powerful Navy, it is even more powerful when it works
with the US military. We all need to take out ISIS and other terrorist
groups.</p>
<p>We have complimentary economies, we can trade together. Trump has
criticised Mexico and China for taking American jobs. The UK is not
Mexico or China. Currencies are always changing but in January, the
figures were:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>US minimum wage: $7.25 per hour</p>
<p>UK minimum wage: $9.31 per hour</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So the minimum wage is higher in the UK than the US, we can trade
together for great mutual benefit with no risk of a race to the
bottom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-hysteria-is-somewhat-external">
<h2>14. The Hysteria is somewhat external</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/hulk.png" src="_images/hulk.png"/>
<p>I am still asking for someone to tell me why President Trump is
uniquely more hysteria-inducing than his predecessors. Most
criticisms, valid or not, apply to a previous President or other.</p>
<p>It seems to me, the biggest difference between now and when President
Bush came into office in 2002, and especially between now and when
Reagan came into office in 1980, is the technological difference.</p>
<p>It was through better use of technology that allowed Donald Trump to
leapfrog the big corporate media companies and beat 16 other
candidates and the Democrats.</p>
<p>However, the same is true on the other side, that there is an echo
chamber provided by social media and the World Wide Web which seems to
magnify the hysteria.</p>
<p>Meanwhile email and the web give the ability to organise an event or
protest far more cheaply and efficiently than in the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technology-is-always-more-important">
<h2>15. Technology is always more important</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/unicron.jpg" src="_images/unicron.jpg"/>
<p>2016 was a big year in politics but it is important to remember that
politics is merely a response to cultural change which is driven by
technological change. Politics is dealing with the
symptoms. Technology is the underlying cause.</p>
<p>The invention of the printing press allowed an information revolution
which led to the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and the Industrial
Revolution. The consequences continued for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, it was the final
piece that allowed a new information revolution to begin. President
Donald Trump and those opposing him are political results of this
revolution but they will not be the last. This thing will run for
hundreds of years.</p>
<p>As Sir Winston Churchill said, “Now this is not the end. It is not
even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the
beginning.”</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/sunrise.jpg" src="_images/sunrise.jpg"/>
<p>I have never met a Leave voter who wanted to stay inside the Single
Market or Customs Union. Quite the opposite. It seems pretty clear to
me that leave the European Union means leave it.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-people-were-the-jury">
<h2>The people were the jury</h2>
<p>In order to secure re-election, the government offered an EU in-out
referendum in their May 2015 election manifesto.</p>
<p>Prime Minister David Cameron tried to do a last-ditch
compromise with the EU but it refused to offer any meaningful
concessions.</p>
<p>In the 13 months between election and referendum, those who wanted to
remain or leave the EU made their arguments in a campaign that (to me)
seemed to go on forever.</p>
<p>The whole point of a vote is that it was up to the British public to
decide who to believe, to act as a jury to judge whose arguments were
right and whose were wrong.</p>
<p>In a historic turnout, 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU, more
than have ever voted for anything before.</p>
<p>After the 13 months of the focus being on Brexit, I thought the vote
would decide it and the focus of the nation would move on to other
topics. No such luck.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cadaveric-spasms">
<h2>Cadaveric spasms</h2>
<p>Several politicians and prominent establishment figures on the remain
side of the argument have never accepted the result and have been
replaying the already too-long campaign all over again.</p>
<p>These establishment figures didn’t learn the most important lesson
from the campaign, that the population are not fools and are not
scared of doom scenarios.</p>
<p>Whenever such a figure says “I respect the result but” and then gives
a ‘project fear’ argument already previously rejected in the vote, it
shows they don’t actually respect the result.</p>
<p>After an initial attempt to get a re-run of the vote failed to gain
traction, they have moved on to try to re-define what leaving the EU
means so that Brexit becomes leaving the EU in name only. It is a
sleight of hand trick.</p>
<p>They started with ‘leaving the EU does not mean leaving the single
market’ but then News shows and Youtubers compiled clips of all the
major figures on both sides before the vote saying leaving the EU
would mean leaving the single market.</p>
<p>Now they are focusing on the ‘Staying in the Customs Union’ as if this
was some separate project. It is not, the Customs Union is the core of
the whole EU. If we stay in the Customs Union, we lose the biggest
advantage of Brexit, and for me personally, half of the point of doing
it at all.</p>
<p>That advantage is having Free Trade deals with the growing part of the
world. I talked more about this several times <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/12/02/occams_racists.html">including in my last post</a>.</p>
<p>In the following table I list 10 Countries that have publicly
approached the UK for a trade deal post-Brexit vote. There may be more
but these ten will prove the point.</p>

<p>The GDP of these 10 countries that seek a trade deal with the UK have
a combined GDP three times larger than the EU 27 and a population 8
times larger. Almost all of these countries have higher GDP growth
than the EU.</p>
<p>Maintaining access to the single market is important, but many times
less important than gaining improved access to these 10 global
markets. The disparity gets wider every day and every year as the
developing world increases both its GDP and its population.</p>
<p>To join the EU, we had to throw away free trade deals that we already
had with many of these countries, so being stuck inside the Customs
Union has made us much poorer than we could have been, and staying
inside it in the future will certainly restrict the UK’s potential
economic growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leaving-twice">
<h2>Leaving Twice</h2>
<p>The raw economic numbers are clear, it is better to have a clean
Brexit and offer the EU a bi-lateral free trade deal. It is also nicer
to our European neighbours in the long run.</p>
<p>If the government goes with some compromised (‘soft’) form of Brexit
that stops the UK making free trade deals, including the power to
remove tariffs and agree common standards etc, then there will just be
a second round of Brexit.</p>
<p>The campaign to leave the EU really began in 1992, it took 24 years to
get enough momentum to win a referendum. The second round will not
take so long, we are mobilised and engaged already.</p>
<p>The UK already annoyed our partners by being in the EU but being
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/07/09/good_fences_make_good_neighbours.html">unhappy tenants</a> - we demanded a (partial) rebate and we refused to
join many of the recent programs such as the Euro, Schengen, etc.</p>
<p>We then voted to leave. If the government signs a deal with the EU in
2019 that includes staying within the Customs Union, but then five or
ten years later, the people vote to leave that too, we are throwing
away any remaining goodwill we have left.</p>
<p>So it much nicer to our European neighbours to leave once, rather than
mess them around by partially leaving and then leaving properly.</p>

<h2>Follow the money</h2>
<p>Those upset about Brexit like to see it as an isolated mistake that
came from nowhere.</p>
<p>This is not a random event. Most events are never isolated, and Brexit
is no different. It is a symptom of a wider trend.</p>
<p>Our exports to the EU have been falling since 2000 and especially
since the financial crash of 2008.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/graph.png" src="_images/graph.png"/>
<p>Meanwhile our trade with the 84% of people that are not in the EU has
been growing.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an economic genius to work out why this has been
happening, the developing world has been booming, while the EU keeps
choosing job destroying policies and then when those jobs are gone,
uses the decline as an excuse to double down on nonsense and kill
some more jobs.</p>
<p>To pick a country almost at random, lets compare the Euro area to
India. The quarterly GDP growth of India is five times higher than the
Eurozone.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/quartgrowth.png" src="_images/quartgrowth.png"/>
<p>This is not a recent trend. Lets look at the ten year graph:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/10year.png" src="_images/10year.png"/>
<p>India’s growth is always higher than the Eurozone, look at 2011, India
can have a battle with Pakistan, risking Nuclear annihilation, and
still not go below the Euroarea’s growth.</p>
<p>This is not just a ten year trend, India has beaten European growth my
whole lifetime. It is repeated across the developing world. The
Eurozone has mostly flat or negative growth, while the developing
world keeps doubling its GDP to very surely catches up to our level of
wealth.</p>
<p>What these graphs show is that for the UK to maximise its wealth, we
have to get out there and be a global trading nation once again.</p>
<p>The 2008 crash showed that the square mile of the city of London
cannot pay for 65 million people. Since then we have just been running
our country on fumes, currency manipulation and denial. We are going
to have to use the whole of the UK and actually make and do things
again that people want to pay for.</p>
<p>There is a lot of spare supply side capacity in the Midlands and
North, and a lot of the human expertise is still there, grey and soon
to leave the workforce but available right now. Luckily, we are waking
up just in time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-remoaners-are-going-to-moan-for-a-generation">
<h2>The remoaners are going to moan for a generation</h2>
<p>I ended my post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/12/01/the_end_of_the_world_is_cancelled.html">The End of the World is Cancelled</a> saying that
Britain and Europe will get beyond Brexit and the relationship will be
better than ever.</p>
<p>We won’t have such luck with our domestic malcontents however. The
long-term inevitable and unavoidable trends above are totally ignored
by Europhiles. It is a zero-sum game where the growing 84% of the
world not in the EU don’t exist.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons for the professional remoaner class. Here
are a few of the most obvious ones:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>People are used to patronage from the EU. However, this was always
our money to start with, we can calm the nerves Universities and
Museums etc by stuffing their mouths full of gold. There is so much
waste and duplication in the EU that we can double the grants of
everyone and still be in profit.</li>
<li>EU salaries are often unbelievably good with endless handy perks. So
Brexit has cut off the easy career path for a lot of the
establishment who were expecting to upgrade to the European level:
judges, politicians, civil servants, policy wonks, etc.</li>
<li>EU elections happen between UK government elections, so for MPs, it
is handy backup option to become an MEP if you are unexpectedly get
kicked out by the voters. European elections are based on a list
system so it doesn’t matter how personally unpopular you have
become. Likewise minsters and high level civil servants can become
commissioners and so on.</li>
<li>Due to the above reduction in insider jobs, the private sector
revolving door has never been more powerful. The finance industry
has a lot of spare cash (time for more taxes?) and it hasn’t
demobilised from the Referendum campaign. MPs like Nick Clegg who
seem unlikely to keep their seat at the next election, are gearing
up for the next job. Just <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/797894120664604673">look how much cash</a> he is already taking
from the banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on, but if you have read my post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/12/01/the_treaty_of_losers.html">The Treaty of
Losers</a>, you know I just cannot ignore the Occam’s Razor question
that is bugging me. Maybe it is nothing to do with these reasons
listed above, maybe it is much simpler and more obvious.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Occam’s racists</h2>
<p>Until now, because the UK has been controlled by the EU, it could
never agree to anything with its Commonwealth allies, the Commonwealth
turned into a bit of a talking shop. However, it is turning back into
an important body now.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/commonwealth.jpg" src="_images/commonwealth.jpg"/>
<p>As I talked about in previous posts, citizens of the Commonwealth
countries volunteered in their millions to fight and die for us in
World War II. Why wouldn’t everyone want to re-establish links with these
great countries?</p>
<p>Looking back at the first part of this post, we have everything to
gain. Who wouldn’t want to do trade deals with the massively growing
commonwealth economies?</p>
<p>The answer is the remainer politicians and the establishment experts,
who won’t even dare to discuss it. They bang on about having access to
a (declining) market of “500 million people” (which includes UK so it
is actually 435 million) but they never talk about the 2.3 billion
people in Commonwealth or the 6.5 billion in the non-EU rest of the
world.</p>
<p>Is this because it will just undermine their argument or is there
something simpler going on?</p>
<p>Look back at the Commonwealth Heads of State, now look at the EU leaders:</p>

<p>In my previous posts, I talked about the importance of us as a country
getting involved in the Commonwealth countries. Luckily we have an
opening. The Commonwealth countries are still there and they want to
work with us, with a bit of humility, the former masters can become
the servants. There is a lot of goods, services and expertise we can
provide to help the continued development of their countries.</p>
<p>My main point throughout my Brexit posts is that I do not believe that
having a bilateral trade arrangement with EU rather than being a
member is Armageddon.</p>
<p>Indeed, when we are finally free of the stifling customs union, we can
really target improved relations with the rest of the
world. Especially the Commonwealth which is now 2.3 billion people and
most of world growth, as well as the United States and anyone else who
wants to come with us in global free but fair trade.</p>

<p>There is a lot of bluster from the EU, but that is for domestic
consumption and deflect from the fact that national leaders in the EU
Council of Ministers thought it could ignore British’s demands for
reforms and the British people wouldn’t call its bluff. It did and now
we have to move on. There is no going back.</p>
<p>On almost every issue, the EU needs UK more than UK needs the EU.</p>

<p>European nations and companies rely on finance from the city of London
and they sell to us a lot more than we sell to them.</p>
<p>If the EU does not give tariff free access to the EU, the UK will
retaliate in kind. The EU has already lost a lot of jobs due to
putting sanctions on Russia, many areas of Europe will be equally
badly hit if this happens.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have a free floating currency, we can win any tariff war
by devaluing the pound. The Bank of England can buy back government
debt through quantitative easing. Our exports become cheaper, removing
the effect of the EU’s tariff, the government has less debt and
domestic production becomes more competitive. Triple win.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside the customs union, we can substitute almost any EU
product with far cheaper global imports. South African or Australian
wine might not initially have the same brand power as French wine but
it still gets you drunk, and fashion is not a one way street, they can
also move to meet the circumstances.</p>

<p>UK is the main military power of Europe. European leaders know if they
anger the British public so much that defending EU countries becomes
politically impossible, then how will it defend itself from Putin’s
next adventure?</p>
<p>Meanwhile The EU does not have the money to create an equivalent force
and it takes a long time to make the martial culture required to be
effective. In Afghanistan, the German troops refused to leave base
without British guards. Putin’s men have no such scruples.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-nation-of-immigrants">
<h2>A nation of immigrants</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/deli.jpg" src="_images/deli.jpg"/>
<p>Ignoring the Irish people who are unaffected by Brexit due to
pre-existing and ancient rights, there are three million great and
mostly young people working in Britain from other EU countries. It is
going up not down since Brexit. Due to the relative economic strength
of the UK.</p>
<p>Those from Eastern Europe send remittances back to their families
which is spent in local shops, this is quite important to the economy
of many Eastern Europe countries.</p>
<p>Whereas the largest proportion of the one million British people in
Europe are retired people in the Sun. On the whole, these seniors
don’t need working rights, they don’t take the jobs, they just shop,
eat and drink, providing essential extra income into otherwise quite
fragile seaside areas.</p>
<p>We can offer whatever terms we want or don’t want. It doesn’t matter,
the EU will have to accept them.</p>
<p>The EU deals with both trade and immigration so with Brexit it is all
mixed up, however normally immigration shouldn’t actually have that much
to do with a trade deal.</p>
<p>We haven’t sent people back to Europe since we beat the viking horde,
we won’t start again now. We never had much immigration control
against Europeans, I doubt anyone will notice that much of a
difference after Brexit. Whatever tests we set (getting to that in a
just a second), most people who want to come here will pass them.</p>
<p>The UK government always makes a meaningless immigration target, but
that is not important. If we engage more with the 84% of the world
that we have been mostly ignoring, then the booming economy will
need more labour.</p>
<p>What people want is control. Post-Brexit immigration system needs to
have the following features:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Vet and interview people coming from terrorist hotspots so we don’t
take in any more terrorists. Throw out existing known terrorists.</li>
<li>Pick the best and brightest people we can find from the whole world.</li>
<li>Treat everyone equally, i.e. don’t discriminate based on race, more
on that in a future post.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once immigration has a defensible system, it will stop being a
political football and people will stop worrying about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-will-all-be-fine">
<h2>It will all be fine</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/eurostar.jpg" src="_images/eurostar.jpg"/>
<p>Since we joined the EU, we outsourced most of the important decisions
to Brussels but the employee count of Whitehall and the rest of the
British government did not get smaller, it just kept increasing. So
over 30 years this increasingly pointless, bloated and atrophied class
of bureaucrats is used to being told what to do.</p>
<p>Now these bureaucrats are panicking because finally they have to take
some responsibility and do some work. Like an unused muscle it is
providing resistance and some of it might be dead weight.</p>
<p>If I was a government department I would be showing how useful I am to
the process of creating new UK systems. Obstructions might find
themselves being worked around and replaced.</p>
<p>Assuming the government can provide leadership and overcome this
addiction to sloth, Brexit is going to be fine.</p>
<p>It is interesting how the government created a new department for
Brexit and a new department for International Trade. A new broom can
clean best.</p>
<p>A full Brexit will finally lance the boil of frustration over Europe
and allow us all to get on with things. As I said before in my post
“<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/07/09/good_fences_make_good_neighbours.html">Good fences make good neighbours</a>”, Britain will go from being an
unhappy tenant of the EU to Europe’s most supportive neighbour and
ally.</p>
<p>We will get a workable free trade deal. The rest of Europe will get
over it, indeed Britain never joined the Euro, Schengen, Fiscal
Compact and dozens of other things, so in a decade, people in Europe
will have forgotten that the UK was ever a member.</p>
<p>No such luck with our own domestic moaners, they will go on for a
generation. More on that later.</p>

<p>In this signing ceremony, they are meeting on the Capitoline Hill, the
very centre of the Roman Empire. This symbolism is not to be
ignored. They specifically chose to wrap this new Union in the
symbolism of the previous attempts to unite the peoples of Europe (
see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs the Matrix</a> for a lot more on this topic).</p>
<p>This treaty of signed by War dodgers of the Axis countries that just
lost World War II, yet in their head they Roman emperors.</p>
<div class="section" id="union-of-europeans">
<h2>Union of Europeans</h2>
<p>The EU traces its origin to this Treaty of Rome, the first line is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>DETERMINED to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of
Europe,</div></blockquote>
<p>On that same first page, we have a resolution “to eliminate the
barriers which divide Europe” and to ensure “harmonious development”
by “reducing the differences existing between the various regions”. It
goes on in much the same way for 80 pages.</p>
<p>The implication of it all is that Europeans are a single people
accidentally separated by borders and they should fix it with an ever
closer union.</p>
<p>In my post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs the Matrix</a>, I talked about how from Roman times
until today, they have been trying to reunite Continental Europe.</p>
<p>The most immediate pre-brexit example is of course Hitler’s attempt to
unify Europe in a Nazi Empire which I talked about in the
post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/11/06/godwin_part_two.html">Godwin part two</a>.</p>
<p>In short, the all white master race lost to the multi-racial armies of
the Allies.</p>
<p>Both the Nazi empire and the EU follow an atheistic secular scientific
approach, with religion and Christian culture pushed deep out of
public life.</p>
<p>Most importantly they both use Roman era symbolism for their ends. The
EU is a Union of White majority countries, with a customs union of
external tariffs seeking to partially insulate the European economies
from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>If you are from Bulgaria or Finland, you have freedom of movement to
work and live into the UK, but if you are from Kenya or India, you do
not. The former countries are white European countries, the latter are
not. <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#the-question-that-remain-will-never-answer">I am not the only one who spotted this</a>.</p>
<p>Mein Kampf is written by a deranged socialist artist who became a
dictator. The treaty of Rome is written by lawyers. However, they both
have this concept of a United European people, both times they have a
white majority, how convenient.</p>
<p>The deep pool of racism that led the Axis populations to condone
Hitler didn’t magically disappear when the allied soldiers rolled
in.</p>
<p>This concept of a unified European people is the middle-class educated
lawyer’s version of a master race. Once you understand this, all the
white supremacist euphemisms used knowingly and unknowingly by
Europhiles become clear.</p>
<p>For myself, I don’t believe in this concept of a special united
European people. I think someone from South Africa or Pakistan is
equal to someone from Finland or Slovakia. We should work with
everyone and not put up barriers to the 84% of humanity that are not
in the EU, we should be equally open to everyone.</p>

<p>I had meant to write a sequel to my 2007 <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/archive/2007/06/27/archimedes-why-godwin-was-wrong/">post on Godwin’s
law</a>. Over, ten years later, here I am.</p>
<p>The book Mein Kampf is the demented ravings of Hitler. It comes in two
parts. The first volume is an autobiography and the second is his
manifesto of National Socialism and his plan for a “new order”, which
later he had an opportunity to try out.</p>
<p>Hitler’s philosophy was socialist in that he aimed to abolish
individualism. He believed this process should begin from birth, and
children should be educated in a system of total control, that
minimises parental influence in favour of the ideas of the Nazi state.</p>
<p>The book also spends time explaining Hitler’s atheism, and his desire
to remove Christianity from all public society. Obviously I don’t need
to explain his views toward Jews. Hitler believed in pre-Christian
neo-pagan style beliefs with his famous vegetarianism. He believed the
pre-Christian Roman Era under Julius Caesar and Emperor Augustus was
the high point of humanity.</p>
<p>Hitler believed in allying with certain Christian groups if it suited
his strive for power, at least until after he had created his empire
then he could totally abolish it.</p>
<p>For Hitler, Christianity is a Jewish plot to keep Europeans from
understanding their true ancient “Aryan identity”, their natural
superiority from being white and more highly evolved. Everyone else,
including Slavic peoples, were Untermensch, subhumans.</p>
<p>Albert Speer, quoted Hitler in his book Inside the Third Reich:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“You see, it’s been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why
didn’t we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice
for the fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion
too would have been much more compatible to us than
Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness
and flabbiness?”</div></blockquote>
<p>Instead of a heavenly Kingdom, Hitler believed it was his destiny to
create a united Europe with himself at the centre. A new Roman Empire,
with himself as Emperor. An Empire without meat, smoking or alcohol.</p>
<p>When George Orwell reviewed the book for a magazine, he called
Hilter’s vision of a united Europe: “a horrible brainless empire”.</p>
<p>His atheistic secular scientific approach did mean he spent an
enormous sum on Universities and research and development. Which is
why at the end of World War 2, the allies raced with each other to
grab all the Nazi scientists.</p>
<p>However, Nazi Germany couldn’t get many of their innovations into
production in time to help prevent the total loss to the Allies. As it
turned out, this master race of white Europeans wasn’t as good as it
thought it was.</p>
<p>As I talked about in the previous posts, it is important not to forget
how diverse the Allied armies were. The white European master race
lost to the mixed multi-racial British Empire army, the segregated
multi-racial American army and the Slavic Soviet army.</p>
<p>People are just people. There is no white superiority, if there was
Hitler would have won the Second World War. There is no need to repeat
the monstrous experiment.</p>
<p>How socialist National Socialism actually was is one of those issues
to be debated forever.</p>
<p>The ambition to abolish Christianity is always the hallmark of
authoritarianism, likewise the desire for the state to indoctrinate
children instead of letting parents teach children their own ideas.</p>
<p>More superficially, whenever a vegetarian or teetotaler imposes their
policy on the majority, I think of Hitler’s plan for his eventual
joyless Empire.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/clintonwikileaks.png" src="_images/clintonwikileaks.png"/>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> has once again come up with some fantastic insights into how
the elite run the world. Reading the different leaks from people
associated with Hillary Clinton is fascinating. We are really getting
a deep view into the globalist mindset.</p>
<p>The emails showing <a class="reference external" href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#efmAIuAMKAViAXv">what Hillary was promising to her wall street donors</a> are
particularly enlightening.</p>
<p>If her actions and choices seem incomprehensible, you have understand
that Clinton and her friends have a very different view of the world
than us normal people. Especially those of us who hold to romantic
ideas like God and country and loving your neighbours as yourself.</p>
<p>As always, click to enlarge the images.</p>
<div class="section" id="different-crib">
<h2>Different crib</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/clintonhouse.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/clintonhouse-small.jpg" src="_images/clintonhouse-small.jpg"/></a>
<p>If you think that Hillary’s best known house, the house in Chappaqua,
is pretty reserved and tasteful for the elite, it is, but you have to
remember that this is not a ranch in the middle of the Texan desert,
it is at the end of a private road in the suburbs of New York City. It
is a mega-great house.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/clintonhouse2.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/clintonhouse2-small.jpg" src="_images/clintonhouse2-small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The house is surrounded by a large white wall, and a manned guardhouse
stands by the entrance to the property. Yes, the anti-wall Clinton
likes her own walls very much.</p>
<p>The red barn at the back is not for chickens, it is where her
household staff and armed security are hidden away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a small fleet of armoured vehicles provide suitable
transport for any occasion.</p>

<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/notmyschool.png"><img alt="../../../_images/notmyschool-small.png" src="_images/notmyschool-small.png"/></a>
<p>In 2016 figures, the <a class="reference external" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A229RX0">per capita disposable income</a> of an American
citizen is $39,190. Chelsea Clinton went to a school where tuition and
fees cost $48,160 in 2016/2017. And yes, it has a massive green campus
with a giant fence around it. The school campus makes Clinton’s house
look like a hovel.</p>
<p>If Hillary doesn’t care about what provision is needed to handle mass
immigration to inner cities, it is partly because she doesn’t need to
use the overwhelmed schools or local services herself.</p>
<p>If Hillary seems a bit disrespectful towards the police, it is because
she doesn’t need them, she has her own armed guards.</p>
<p>We can go on like this forever, so lets zoom out a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="different-map">
<h2>Different Map</h2>
<p>Almost every country has at least one thing to be proud of. As the
British people, we are proud of our hard won freedoms and the communal
institutions that our ancestors left us such as the NHS, our Royal
Navy, our Royal family, our state school system, our ancient churches,
castles, national parks and so on.</p>
<p>This means nothing to Hillary and their tribe, they are globalists
because they are so rich they don’t want or need a nation state to
look after them. From the first class cabin and the private jet, every
country looks the same, the same hotel chains, the same exclusive
shops, etc. The rich already live in a generic border free world.</p>
<p>If we draw a map of world according to Hillary’s email, it will look
like this (<a class="reference external" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/ColoredBlankMap-World-10E.svg">map credit to Wikipedia</a>, click on the map below to enlarge):</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/clintonworld.svg.png"><img alt="../../../_images/clintonworld-small.svg.png" src="_images/clintonworld-small.svg.png"/></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-run-the-world">
<h2>How to run the world</h2>
<p>The power structures of the globalist world view are really
interesting but also quite basic. There are four levers they have to
control the world. I will explain this using the above map.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Trade policy</li>
</ol>
<p>To Hillary and her ilk, California is the capital of the world,
eventually drawing all of the Americas into a “greater California”.</p>
<p>By combining this Reino de Clintoñia with its two major colonies of
Eurabia and Pacifica, we have a giant and generic service economy,
ready to serve the elite’s every desire.</p>
<p>All the trade agreements like TTIP, TPP and the EU are there to make
sure the servants do not become too uppity and to remove any barriers
to the maximisation of profits for Goldman Sachs bankers and the
others who fund Clinton and her friends.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Patronage</li>
</ol>
<p>As well as unifying the legal and trade systems, patronage is used to
keep potentially dangerous alternate power structures such as
intellectuals, religion and the media on board. Internal ‘markets’ and
competition for grants keep the universities, NGOs and charities as
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">useful idiots</a> spreading the globalist gospel.</p>
<p>It is important to create pseudo-scientific pretences of why this
globalist neo-feudal system benefits the population more generally, as
opposed to more Occam’s razor like solutions such as lets take the
rich’s wealth away and use it to cure cancer.</p>
<p>This is also why the current move towards cultural Marxism and
identity politics suits the elite so well. David Cameron and the
American democrat/republican one party state are happy to hand out gay
marriage because it doesn’t cost them any money. Here <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrwcS4n1kzQ">have all the pronouns you want</a>,
just don’t ask for decent housing for the poor, infrastructure or services.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Consumer goods and entertainment</li>
</ol>
<p>2000 years ago, the Roman writer Juvenal coined the phrase ‘panem et
circenses’ (bread and circuses) to explain how the elite kept the
masses under control.</p>
<p>The classical theory of why the Roman empire fell includes the
observation that through insecurity of trade routes and inflation,
Rome stopped being able to provide affordable consumer goods to the
people.</p>
<p>The global leaders today do not make the same mistake, they keep their
servant class in check by exploiting the poor of the world. They keep
Chinese goods cheap, and if the Chinese get sick of making plastic
crap for the world, they keep plenty of other Asian countries poor as
a backup, after that there is Africa, which is currently just used as
a giant shop of minerals to be exploited.</p>
<p>[I have talked a lot lately in this blog about how Africa bears the
brunt of the current system of world trade, so I don’t want to sound
like a broken record, needless to say, every trade deal they make
always includes massive tariffs against Sub-Saharan African
countries.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are in an entertainment golden age, no end of TV shows,
films and sports are provided to keep the minds of the servants
busy. While there is an attempt to reclaim costs to pay the cast and
crew and so on, unauthorised distribution of media is rampant and
tolerated as only thing worse than the people watching unauthorised TV
is the people not watching it.</p>
<p>If the mainstream media is rejected by the people, then a major form
of control is lost, thus the mad dash to control and censor the Web.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Useful enemy</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever Clinton and other Western politicians get into trouble,
Russia and a few other useful enemies are wheeled out as a useful
excuse for pretty much anything.</p>
<p>There is a Goldilocks zone for useful enemies, not too big and not too
small, Putin was getting too big for his boots so sanctions were used
to make Russia’s GDP smaller than Australia, meanwhile Iran was on the
verge of total collapse so Obama and Clinton recently removed its
sanctions and bailed out the regime with billions of dollars.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="another-way">
<h2>Another way</h2>
<p>We are finally at a level of technology where we can in our lifetimes,
foresee a future free of disease, want or waste, where robots do the
work and people are free.</p>
<p>After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, when FDR decided to pursue a war
across two oceans, the US had no ability to fight a major foreign war
on one front, let alone two. Yet he pulled everyone together, rich and
poor, black and white, and together they got the job done.</p>
<p>Setting a national goal and putting the resources of the whole society
into it can achieve massive things:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the
goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to earth.”</div></blockquote>
<p>When JFK said the above quote, they had a general idea of the physical
principles but no practical clue how to achieve it. We now know far
more about cancer and other diseases than we knew about the moon
in 1961.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we will commit ourselves to curing cancer in
ten years, to curing type 1 diabetes, to ending asthma in children.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we are going to digitise our cars so that in
five years time, the number of child deaths on the road is 0.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we will build a house for every person who
needs one, even if we have to take away a little land from wealthy
estates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-not-important">
<h2>What is not important</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/disapprove.png"><img alt="../../../_images/disapprove-small.png" src="_images/disapprove-small.png"/></a>
<p>The whole reality TV side of things I don’t really care about. I don’t
care if Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t wear a tie or Boris Johnson has made
inappropriate jokes about foreign dictators. I don’t care if Labour MPs
feel unhappy with Corbyn’s management style or Theresa May is
alienating the 48% (which is now more like the 13% according to the
latest polling but lets not get off track).</p>
<p>I do think it is somewhat odd that almost all of the Labour shadow
cabinet come from London while almost all of the Tory Cabinet come
from the home counties, but if they were the best people they could
get, then I guess I don’t care.</p>
<p>I don’t care if Trump said something sexist 20 years ago, I don’t care
if he makes his staff lose weight, I don’t care what he did when we
was a billionaire playboy and a businessman.</p>
<p>I don’t care that the Clintons have a weird open marriage where, to
use Hillary’s own terminology, she has to herd around Bill’s discarded
‘bimbos’. I don’t care how much Hillary swears in her emails. I
don’t care she called her own party “a bucket of losers.” I don’t care
if she coughs constantly for 8 years in a row.</p>
<p>I don’t care about temperament, I don’t care about who is the best
manager. I don’t care who is the best husband or wife or mother or
father.</p>
<p>I just want them to put these lilliputian tabloid issues aside and
have some real policies to do something worthwhile for the actual
voters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="champions-not-tokens">
<h2>Champions not tokens</h2>
<p>The lives of the elite and the normal people are divided as never
before. However, we don’t need leaders who feign the common touch. We
don’t want token leaders, we want champions of the people.</p>
<p>Churchill was born into vast wealth, he was a drunk who gambled away
the wealth of two great families and said many outrageous and sexist
things, he would have probably been called deplorable and irredeemable
by Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>However, Churchill put all his privileged background and personal
contacts into one aim, being the best military leader he could be.</p>
<p>When the time came that Britain was in the existential crisis of World
War II, Churchill, being friends or related to much of the elite, knew
exactly where their money was. The rich did not get off easy in cash
terms and many of the Lordly estates were broken up. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/land-requisitioned-war/">According to the
national archives</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“a total of 14.5 million acres of land, 25 million square feet of
industrial and storage premises and 113,350 holdings of non-industrial
premises were requisitioned by the State.”</div></blockquote>
<p>If we can raid the rich to defeat Hitler, can’t we raid them again to
defeat cancer?</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/firefox1.jpg" src="_images/firefox1.jpg"/>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2014/01/12/installing_multiple_versions_of_firefox.html">last time I talked about the web browser</a>, I was technically
speaking about Iceweasel. For the last decade, Linux users like me
have known the default browser that Debian ships under the name of
Iceweasel.</p>
<p>In 2006, due to some hysteria over trademark protection and typical
West Coast America “we know better than you” attitude, Mozilla told
Debian it could not use the name Firefox or the Firefox logo.</p>
<p>Can we even use it here? Well since we don’t want to be told off by
Mozilla’s logo police, we can use images of some beautiful people who
have made their own dramatic and artistic costume interpretations of
the logo. This blog is 90% about cool and silly pictures after all.</p>
<p>After 10 years of Debian using the name Iceweasel and its own logo,
eventually, Mozilla <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815006">gave up and asked Debian to use the normal name and logo</a>.
Lets celebrate with another costume:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/firefox2.jpg" src="_images/firefox2.jpg"/>
<p>Thanks Iceweasel for your service, we will miss you. LWM published
<a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/676799/">a longer discussion of this change</a>. Incidentally, Google’s Browser is
still called Chromium instead of Chrome on the Debian Linux
platform. I could only find one Chrome costume:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/chrome.jpg" src="_images/chrome.jpg"/>
<p>He (or she) looks pretty happy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this week Firefox 48 has been released which, among other
things, has caught up with a feature that Chromium has had for a while,
namely multiple processes.</p>
<p>Making the browser render web content or play media in a subprocess is
obviously a win for security and performance, especially on Liunx.</p>
<p>Processes are the main native form of efficient resource allocation on
Linux, so now Firefox is using multiple processes it is finally
working with the grain rather against it.</p>
<p>It is still early days. Nothing has crashed for me yet, but I am
keeping the Firefox that Debian distributes (which at time of writing
is version 45), around just in case. You might want to consider doing
the same, especially if you are using extensions which may not work in
the multiprocess mode yet.</p>
<p>To try it out, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/">download Firefox</a>. By the way in my <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2014/01/12/installing_multiple_versions_of_firefox.html">last post about
Firefox</a>, I talked about how to run multiple Versions of Firefox and
how to create an extra profile, which might be handy.</p>
<p>Firefox is pretty cautious about turning multiprocess mode on but
putting <a class="reference external" href="about:status">about:status</a> into the browser will tell you if it is on or
off. As in the image below:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/firefox.png" src="_images/firefox.png"/>
<p>If you find it is off, you can make a new profile (as I just
mentioned) or you can open <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a> and toggle the setting called
browser.tabs.remote.autostart to true. Then you can go back to
<a class="reference external" href="about:status">about:status</a> and see if it worked.</p>
<p>It still might be off because of whatever reason, i.e. they it might
break an extension or whatever. If you want to push on anyway then you
have to open <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a> again and make a new boolean setting called
browser.tabs.remote.force-enable and set that to true. Find more
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis#Firefox_Release">instructions here</a>.</p>
<p>So well done to all the Mozilla developers and volunteers who wrote
and shipped that. Just for you, another of those great Firefox
costumes:</p>
