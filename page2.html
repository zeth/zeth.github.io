<p>Whenever a European Union politician wanted to dismiss the UK’s input

is common about the Inner Six is that they were either all Axis
countries or surrendered at the first major German offensive. They are
really the “Inner Losers” of World War II.</p>

<p>In this signing ceremony, they are meeting on the Capitoline Hill, the
very centre of the Roman Empire. This symbolism is not to be
ignored. They specifically chose to wrap this new Union in the
symbolism of the previous attempts to unite the peoples of Europe (
see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs the Matrix</a> for a lot more on this topic).</p>
<p>This treaty of signed by War dodgers of the Axis countries that just
lost World War II, yet in their head they Roman emperors.</p>
<div class="section" id="union-of-europeans">
<h2>Union of Europeans</h2>
<p>The EU traces its origin to this Treaty of Rome, the first line is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>DETERMINED to lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of
Europe,</div></blockquote>
<p>On that same first page, we have a resolution “to eliminate the
barriers which divide Europe” and to ensure “harmonious development”
by “reducing the differences existing between the various regions”. It
goes on in much the same way for 80 pages.</p>
<p>The implication of it all is that Europeans are a single people
accidentally separated by borders and they should fix it with an ever
closer union.</p>
<p>In my post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">Rome Vs the Matrix</a>, I talked about how from Roman times
until today, they have been trying to reunite Continental Europe.</p>
<p>The most immediate pre-brexit example is of course Hitler’s attempt to
unify Europe in a Nazi Empire which I talked about in the
post <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/11/06/godwin_part_two.html">Godwin part two</a>.</p>
<p>In short, the all white master race lost to the multi-racial armies of
the Allies.</p>
<p>Both the Nazi empire and the EU follow an atheistic secular scientific
approach, with religion and Christian culture pushed deep out of
public life.</p>
<p>Most importantly they both use Roman era symbolism for their ends. The
EU is a Union of White majority countries, with a customs union of
external tariffs seeking to partially insulate the European economies
from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>If you are from Bulgaria or Finland, you have freedom of movement to
work and live into the UK, but if you are from Kenya or India, you do
not. The former countries are white European countries, the latter are
not. <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#the-question-that-remain-will-never-answer">I am not the only one who spotted this</a>.</p>
<p>Mein Kampf is written by a deranged socialist artist who became a
dictator. The treaty of Rome is written by lawyers. However, they both
have this concept of a United European people, both times they have a
white majority, how convenient.</p>
<p>The deep pool of racism that led the Axis populations to condone
Hitler didn’t magically disappear when the allied soldiers rolled
in.</p>
<p>This concept of a unified European people is the middle-class educated
lawyer’s version of a master race. Once you understand this, all the
white supremacist euphemisms used knowingly and unknowingly by
Europhiles become clear.</p>
<p>For myself, I don’t believe in this concept of a special united
European people. I think someone from South Africa or Pakistan is
equal to someone from Finland or Slovakia. We should work with
everyone and not put up barriers to the 84% of humanity that are not
in the EU, we should be equally open to everyone.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/augustus.png" src="_images/augustus.png"/>
<p>I had meant to write a sequel to my 2007 <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/archive/2007/06/27/archimedes-why-godwin-was-wrong/">post on Godwin’s
law</a>. Over, ten years later, here I am.</p>
<p>The book Mein Kampf is the demented ravings of Hitler. It comes in two
parts. The first volume is an autobiography and the second is his
manifesto of National Socialism and his plan for a “new order”, which
later he had an opportunity to try out.</p>
<p>Hitler’s philosophy was socialist in that he aimed to abolish
individualism. He believed this process should begin from birth, and
children should be educated in a system of total control, that
minimises parental influence in favour of the ideas of the Nazi state.</p>
<p>The book also spends time explaining Hitler’s atheism, and his desire
to remove Christianity from all public society. Obviously I don’t need
to explain his views toward Jews. Hitler believed in pre-Christian
neo-pagan style beliefs with his famous vegetarianism. He believed the
pre-Christian Roman Era under Julius Caesar and Emperor Augustus was
the high point of humanity.</p>
<p>Hitler believed in allying with certain Christian groups if it suited
his strive for power, at least until after he had created his empire
then he could totally abolish it.</p>
<p>For Hitler, Christianity is a Jewish plot to keep Europeans from
understanding their true ancient “Aryan identity”, their natural
superiority from being white and more highly evolved. Everyone else,
including Slavic peoples, were Untermensch, subhumans.</p>
<p>Albert Speer, quoted Hitler in his book Inside the Third Reich:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“You see, it’s been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why
didn’t we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice
for the fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion
too would have been much more compatible to us than
Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness
and flabbiness?”</div></blockquote>
<p>Instead of a heavenly Kingdom, Hitler believed it was his destiny to
create a united Europe with himself at the centre. A new Roman Empire,
with himself as Emperor. An Empire without meat, smoking or alcohol.</p>
<p>When George Orwell reviewed the book for a magazine, he called
Hilter’s vision of a united Europe: “a horrible brainless empire”.</p>
<p>His atheistic secular scientific approach did mean he spent an
enormous sum on Universities and research and development. Which is
why at the end of World War 2, the allies raced with each other to
grab all the Nazi scientists.</p>
<p>However, Nazi Germany couldn’t get many of their innovations into
production in time to help prevent the total loss to the Allies. As it
turned out, this master race of white Europeans wasn’t as good as it
thought it was.</p>
<p>As I talked about in the previous posts, it is important not to forget
how diverse the Allied armies were. The white European master race
lost to the mixed multi-racial British Empire army, the segregated
multi-racial American army and the Slavic Soviet army.</p>
<p>People are just people. There is no white superiority, if there was
Hitler would have won the Second World War. There is no need to repeat
the monstrous experiment.</p>
<p>How socialist National Socialism actually was is one of those issues
to be debated forever.</p>
<p>The ambition to abolish Christianity is always the hallmark of
authoritarianism, likewise the desire for the state to indoctrinate
children instead of letting parents teach children their own ideas.</p>
<p>More superficially, whenever a vegetarian or teetotaler imposes their
policy on the majority, I think of Hitler’s plan for his eventual
joyless Empire.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/clintonwikileaks.png" src="_images/clintonwikileaks.png"/>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> has once again come up with some fantastic insights into how
the elite run the world. Reading the different leaks from people
associated with Hillary Clinton is fascinating. We are really getting
a deep view into the globalist mindset.</p>
<p>The emails showing <a class="reference external" href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/927#efmAIuAMKAViAXv">what Hillary was promising to her wall street donors</a> are
particularly enlightening.</p>
<p>If her actions and choices seem incomprehensible, you have understand
that Clinton and her friends have a very different view of the world
than us normal people. Especially those of us who hold to romantic
ideas like God and country and loving your neighbours as yourself.</p>
<p>As always, click to enlarge the images.</p>
<div class="section" id="different-crib">
<h2>Different crib</h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/clintonhouse.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/clintonhouse-small.jpg" src="_images/clintonhouse-small.jpg"/></a>
<p>If you think that Hillary’s best known house, the house in Chappaqua,
is pretty reserved and tasteful for the elite, it is, but you have to
remember that this is not a ranch in the middle of the Texan desert,
it is at the end of a private road in the suburbs of New York City. It
is a mega-great house.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/clintonhouse2.jpg"><img alt="../../../_images/clintonhouse2-small.jpg" src="_images/clintonhouse2-small.jpg"/></a>
<p>The house is surrounded by a large white wall, and a manned guardhouse
stands by the entrance to the property. Yes, the anti-wall Clinton
likes her own walls very much.</p>
<p>The red barn at the back is not for chickens, it is where her
household staff and armed security are hidden away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a small fleet of armoured vehicles provide suitable
transport for any occasion.</p>

<p>In 2016 figures, the <a class="reference external" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A229RX0">per capita disposable income</a> of an American
citizen is $39,190. Chelsea Clinton went to a school where tuition and
fees cost $48,160 in 2016/2017. And yes, it has a massive green campus
with a giant fence around it. The school campus makes Clinton’s house
look like a hovel.</p>
<p>If Hillary doesn’t care about what provision is needed to handle mass
immigration to inner cities, it is partly because she doesn’t need to
use the overwhelmed schools or local services herself.</p>
<p>If Hillary seems a bit disrespectful towards the police, it is because
she doesn’t need them, she has her own armed guards.</p>
<p>We can go on like this forever, so lets zoom out a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="different-map">
<h2>Different Map</h2>
<p>Almost every country has at least one thing to be proud of. As the
British people, we are proud of our hard won freedoms and the communal
institutions that our ancestors left us such as the NHS, our Royal
Navy, our Royal family, our state school system, our ancient churches,
castles, national parks and so on.</p>
<p>This means nothing to Hillary and their tribe, they are globalists
because they are so rich they don’t want or need a nation state to
look after them. From the first class cabin and the private jet, every
country looks the same, the same hotel chains, the same exclusive
shops, etc. The rich already live in a generic border free world.</p>
<p>If we draw a map of world according to Hillary’s email, it will look
like this (<a class="reference external" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/ColoredBlankMap-World-10E.svg">map credit to Wikipedia</a>, click on the map below to enlarge):</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/newimages/posts/world_according_to_clinton_email/clintonworld.svg.png"><img alt="../../../_images/clintonworld-small.svg.png" src="_images/clintonworld-small.svg.png"/></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-run-the-world">
<h2>How to run the world</h2>
<p>The power structures of the globalist world view are really
interesting but also quite basic. There are four levers they have to
control the world. I will explain this using the above map.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Trade policy</li>
</ol>
<p>To Hillary and her ilk, California is the capital of the world,
eventually drawing all of the Americas into a “greater California”.</p>
<p>By combining this Reino de Clintoñia with its two major colonies of
Eurabia and Pacifica, we have a giant and generic service economy,
ready to serve the elite’s every desire.</p>
<p>All the trade agreements like TTIP, TPP and the EU are there to make
sure the servants do not become too uppity and to remove any barriers
to the maximisation of profits for Goldman Sachs bankers and the
others who fund Clinton and her friends.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Patronage</li>
</ol>
<p>As well as unifying the legal and trade systems, patronage is used to
keep potentially dangerous alternate power structures such as
intellectuals, religion and the media on board. Internal ‘markets’ and
competition for grants keep the universities, NGOs and charities as
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">useful idiots</a> spreading the globalist gospel.</p>
<p>It is important to create pseudo-scientific pretences of why this
globalist neo-feudal system benefits the population more generally, as
opposed to more Occam’s razor like solutions such as lets take the
rich’s wealth away and use it to cure cancer.</p>
<p>This is also why the current move towards cultural Marxism and
identity politics suits the elite so well. David Cameron and the
American democrat/republican one party state are happy to hand out gay
marriage because it doesn’t cost them any money. Here <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrwcS4n1kzQ">have all the pronouns you want</a>,
just don’t ask for decent housing for the poor, infrastructure or services.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Consumer goods and entertainment</li>
</ol>
<p>2000 years ago, the Roman writer Juvenal coined the phrase ‘panem et
circenses’ (bread and circuses) to explain how the elite kept the
masses under control.</p>
<p>The classical theory of why the Roman empire fell includes the
observation that through insecurity of trade routes and inflation,
Rome stopped being able to provide affordable consumer goods to the
people.</p>
<p>The global leaders today do not make the same mistake, they keep their
servant class in check by exploiting the poor of the world. They keep
Chinese goods cheap, and if the Chinese get sick of making plastic
crap for the world, they keep plenty of other Asian countries poor as
a backup, after that there is Africa, which is currently just used as
a giant shop of minerals to be exploited.</p>
<p>[I have talked a lot lately in this blog about how Africa bears the
brunt of the current system of world trade, so I don’t want to sound
like a broken record, needless to say, every trade deal they make
always includes massive tariffs against Sub-Saharan African
countries.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are in an entertainment golden age, no end of TV shows,
films and sports are provided to keep the minds of the servants
busy. While there is an attempt to reclaim costs to pay the cast and
crew and so on, unauthorised distribution of media is rampant and
tolerated as only thing worse than the people watching unauthorised TV
is the people not watching it.</p>
<p>If the mainstream media is rejected by the people, then a major form
of control is lost, thus the mad dash to control and censor the Web.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Useful enemy</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever Clinton and other Western politicians get into trouble,
Russia and a few other useful enemies are wheeled out as a useful
excuse for pretty much anything.</p>
<p>There is a Goldilocks zone for useful enemies, not too big and not too
small, Putin was getting too big for his boots so sanctions were used
to make Russia’s GDP smaller than Australia, meanwhile Iran was on the
verge of total collapse so Obama and Clinton recently removed its
sanctions and bailed out the regime with billions of dollars.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="another-way">
<h2>Another way</h2>
<p>We are finally at a level of technology where we can in our lifetimes,
foresee a future free of disease, want or waste, where robots do the
work and people are free.</p>
<p>After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, when FDR decided to pursue a war
across two oceans, the US had no ability to fight a major foreign war
on one front, let alone two. Yet he pulled everyone together, rich and
poor, black and white, and together they got the job done.</p>
<p>Setting a national goal and putting the resources of the whole society
into it can achieve massive things:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“I believe that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the
goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to earth.”</div></blockquote>
<p>When JFK said the above quote, they had a general idea of the physical
principles but no practical clue how to achieve it. We now know far
more about cancer and other diseases than we knew about the moon
in 1961.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we will commit ourselves to curing cancer in
ten years, to curing type 1 diabetes, to ending asthma in children.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we are going to digitise our cars so that in
five years time, the number of child deaths on the road is 0.</p>
<p>I want a leader that says we will build a house for every person who
needs one, even if we have to take away a little land from wealthy
estates.</p>

<p>The whole reality TV side of things I don’t really care about. I don’t
care if Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t wear a tie or Boris Johnson has made
inappropriate jokes about foreign dictators. I don’t care if Labour MPs
feel unhappy with Corbyn’s management style or Theresa May is
alienating the 48% (which is now more like the 13% according to the
latest polling but lets not get off track).</p>
<p>I do think it is somewhat odd that almost all of the Labour shadow
cabinet come from London while almost all of the Tory Cabinet come
from the home counties, but if they were the best people they could
get, then I guess I don’t care.</p>
<p>I don’t care if Trump said something sexist 20 years ago, I don’t care
if he makes his staff lose weight, I don’t care what he did when we
was a billionaire playboy and a businessman.</p>
<p>I don’t care that the Clintons have a weird open marriage where, to
use Hillary’s own terminology, she has to herd around Bill’s discarded
‘bimbos’. I don’t care how much Hillary swears in her emails. I
don’t care she called her own party “a bucket of losers.” I don’t care
if she coughs constantly for 8 years in a row.</p>
<p>I don’t care about temperament, I don’t care about who is the best
manager. I don’t care who is the best husband or wife or mother or
father.</p>
<p>I just want them to put these lilliputian tabloid issues aside and
have some real policies to do something worthwhile for the actual
voters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="champions-not-tokens">
<h2>Champions not tokens</h2>
<p>The lives of the elite and the normal people are divided as never
before. However, we don’t need leaders who feign the common touch. We
don’t want token leaders, we want champions of the people.</p>
<p>Churchill was born into vast wealth, he was a drunk who gambled away
the wealth of two great families and said many outrageous and sexist
things, he would have probably been called deplorable and irredeemable
by Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>However, Churchill put all his privileged background and personal
contacts into one aim, being the best military leader he could be.</p>
<p>When the time came that Britain was in the existential crisis of World
War II, Churchill, being friends or related to much of the elite, knew
exactly where their money was. The rich did not get off easy in cash
terms and many of the Lordly estates were broken up. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/land-requisitioned-war/">According to the
national archives</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“a total of 14.5 million acres of land, 25 million square feet of
industrial and storage premises and 113,350 holdings of non-industrial
premises were requisitioned by the State.”</div></blockquote>
<p>If we can raid the rich to defeat Hitler, can’t we raid them again to
defeat cancer?</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2014/01/12/installing_multiple_versions_of_firefox.html">last time I talked about the web browser</a>, I was technically
speaking about Iceweasel. For the last decade, Linux users like me
have known the default browser that Debian ships under the name of
Iceweasel.</p>
<p>In 2006, due to some hysteria over trademark protection and typical
West Coast America “we know better than you” attitude, Mozilla told
Debian it could not use the name Firefox or the Firefox logo.</p>
<p>Can we even use it here? Well since we don’t want to be told off by
Mozilla’s logo police, we can use images of some beautiful people who
have made their own dramatic and artistic costume interpretations of
the logo. This blog is 90% about cool and silly pictures after all.</p>
<p>After 10 years of Debian using the name Iceweasel and its own logo,
eventually, Mozilla <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815006">gave up and asked Debian to use the normal name and logo</a>.
Lets celebrate with another costume:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/firefox2.jpg" src="_images/firefox2.jpg"/>
<p>Thanks Iceweasel for your service, we will miss you. LWM published
<a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/676799/">a longer discussion of this change</a>. Incidentally, Google’s Browser is
still called Chromium instead of Chrome on the Debian Linux
platform. I could only find one Chrome costume:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/chrome.jpg" src="_images/chrome.jpg"/>
<p>He (or she) looks pretty happy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this week Firefox 48 has been released which, among other
things, has caught up with a feature that Chromium has had for a while,
namely multiple processes.</p>
<p>Making the browser render web content or play media in a subprocess is
obviously a win for security and performance, especially on Liunx.</p>
<p>Processes are the main native form of efficient resource allocation on
Linux, so now Firefox is using multiple processes it is finally
working with the grain rather against it.</p>
<p>It is still early days. Nothing has crashed for me yet, but I am
keeping the Firefox that Debian distributes (which at time of writing
is version 45), around just in case. You might want to consider doing
the same, especially if you are using extensions which may not work in
the multiprocess mode yet.</p>
<p>To try it out, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/">download Firefox</a>. By the way in my <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2014/01/12/installing_multiple_versions_of_firefox.html">last post about
Firefox</a>, I talked about how to run multiple Versions of Firefox and
how to create an extra profile, which might be handy.</p>
<p>Firefox is pretty cautious about turning multiprocess mode on but
putting <a class="reference external" href="about:status">about:status</a> into the browser will tell you if it is on or
off. As in the image below:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/firefox.png" src="_images/firefox.png"/>
<p>If you find it is off, you can make a new profile (as I just
mentioned) or you can open <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a> and toggle the setting called
browser.tabs.remote.autostart to true. Then you can go back to
<a class="reference external" href="about:status">about:status</a> and see if it worked.</p>
<p>It still might be off because of whatever reason, i.e. they it might
break an extension or whatever. If you want to push on anyway then you
have to open <a class="reference external" href="about:config">about:config</a> again and make a new boolean setting called
browser.tabs.remote.force-enable and set that to true. Find more
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis#Firefox_Release">instructions here</a>.</p>
<p>So well done to all the Mozilla developers and volunteers who wrote
and shipped that. Just for you, another of those great Firefox
costumes:</p>

<div class="section" id="those-who-resort-to-violence-always-lose-their-claim">
<h2>Those who resort to violence, always lose their claim</h2>
<p>After the 18th and 19th centuries, there were many competing
territorial claims over former Prussia; Germany had some valid and
some not so valid claims, as did other countries. Going to war (twice)
over the claims was not valid however.</p>
<p>It is a long standing and basic principle of world order that
the belligerent aggressor loses whatever claims they had. Now of
course Germany is a peaceful and wonderful country and also makes no
claim to any of these areas.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/germany.jpg" src="_images/germany.jpg"/>
<p>Whatever the right or wrongs of the Falklands issue were before 1982,
once Argentina invaded and spilt British blood, they lost any claim to
the islands; it is just how it goes.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/falklands2.jpg" src="_images/falklands2.jpg"/>
<p>It is also an issue of basic democracy that as recently as 2013, the
Falkland Islanders had a referendum with a turnout of 91.94%, where
99.8% voted not to change the Islands’ status in anyway. The results
of referendums must be respected, especially with such a high turnout.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/falklands.jpg" src="_images/falklands.jpg"/>
<p>There is also the practical matter that saying anything different will
be a sure loser in British election.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/israel4.jpg" src="_images/israel4.jpg"/>
<p>Likewise, the question of whether making the state of Israel was the
correct response to the evil of the holocaust, became a non-issue
after 1967. Israel did not start the war, the Arabs did, but the
Israelis won the war and the issue was settled.</p>
<p>Any claims the Arabs had over the land was lost then. You don’t get to
claim territory through starting wars, you must only lose by starting
wars.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-to-boycott-calling-for-boycotts">
<h2>Time to boycott calling for boycotts</h2>
<p>Even if you disagree with Israel’s policies, collective punishment
against its citizens can have no practical effect on those policies.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/israel3-small.jpg" src="_images/israel3-small.jpg"/>
<p>Dis-inviting an innocent academic from a conference, will not change
policy. A professor of Artificial Intelligence or Manuscript Studies
(made up examples for the sake of argument) does not set Israeli
security or foreign policy.</p>
<p>If a UK institution chose an Israeli company to provide a product, it
did so based on price and quality. Pressuring an institution to
boycott the Israeli company will just make innocent workers there
poorer and will mean the UK institution will get a higher priced
and/or lower quality good. An orange juice producer or a software
company does not set Israeli security or foreign policy.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/israel5.jpg" src="_images/israel5.jpg"/>
<p>The same principle applies to exports. Pressuring a UK company to not
sell products to Israel, tractors for example, will not change a
single Israeli policy. It will just mean they buy a tractor from
someone else and workers in the UK have less jobs making tractors.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that there is nothing the UK can usefully do to make
peace in the middle east. Tony Blair of all people tried to be a peace
envoy and yet there is still no peace.</p>
<p>Any politicians that want to pander to either Muslim or Jewish voters
by taking a side are just being dishonest with the voters. The UK just
has no leverage on either side. The Middle East is just not a part of
the world that cares what Britain thinks one way or the other.</p>
<p>Our winning strategy as a country is not to pick sides and just be a
friend to everyone, and of course, sell them all our goods and
services.</p>
<p>By the way, America has far more clout, expertise and money and still
has not made much progress either but that is another story.</p>
<p>Yes there are poor and suffering people in the Middle East, but there
are poor and suffering people everywhere so we should focus on areas
where we are wanted and we can have a meaningful impact, such as
African free trade and development which we have ignored for too long.</p>

<div class="section" id="it-is-not-our-fight">

<img alt="../../../_images/surf.jpg" src="_images/surf.jpg"/>
<p>So it total baffles me why Palestinian liberation or Latin American
politics are cause celebres on the UK left. There are no votes to be
won here.</p>
<p>We talked before about the difference between few hundred thousand
people in the UK who have strong political views and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/08/02/let_them_eat_cake.html">millions who just want cake</a>.</p>
<p>The average British voter does not care a monkeys about Palestine or
improving Anglo-Argentinean relations and just wants to hear domestic
policies.</p>
<p>It seems like Jeremy Corbyn is wise enough to know that there is a
difference in being a backbench MP who can obsess about these obscure
issues and a potential Prime Minister who needs to have total clarity
and focus to cut through a hostile media. I hope so anyway.</p>

<p>On the 23rd June 2016, the people of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland were asked whether they wanted to leave or remain in the
European Union. 52% voted to leave while 48% voted to remain.</p>
<p>On April 10th 2016, ten weeks before the vote, ICM published <a class="reference external" href="https://www.icmunlimited.com/polls/">an opinion poll</a>
that gave a four-point lead for Leave (52% vs 48%), which turned out
to be the correct result.</p>
<p>One explanation is that with several pollsters covering the
referendum, one has to be right; after all, even a stopped clock is
correct twice a day.</p>
<p>However, lets consider an alternative explanation, that the whole EU
referendum campaign made absolutely no difference to public opinion at
all.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of pounds spent by the campaigns, posters,
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/07/02/order_of_magnitude.html">Boris’ bus slogan</a>, acres of newspaper columns,
billions and trillions of tweets, all of it, didn’t manage to
convince anyone of anything.</p>
<p>People are just not that into politics.</p>
<p>In other words, the day to day minutiae of events doesn’t really
matter to the silent majority, they haven’t got the time or the
inclination to care and why should they? It would be very conceited to
say the people should look up and spend their time listening to their
Lords and masters.</p>
<p>The print circulation of Britain’s main broadsheet newspapers has
fallen so far they can barely scrape a million per day combined. What
percentage of their remaining readers do more than browse the news
before going straight to the crossword or the sport section?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, less than 200,000 people in the UK watch the BBC’s political
programmes, but over 15 million people watch ‘The Great British Bake
Off’ on the same network, which is a cake baking competition.</p>
<p>As I <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/748914202933391360">said on Twitter</a>: Politics is important. However, cakes are 75
times more important.</p>
<p>In fact, I don’t want to ever live in a country where politics is more
important than cake, it doesn’t sound like a very benevolent regime.</p>

<p>In the midst of a larger post about the results of the EU referendum,
I talked about the <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#echo-chamber">echo chamber</a> in the campaign. I want to explore
that a tiny bit more.</p>
<p>You also may remember that in a post before the referendum, I talked
about myself as an undergraduate and how I was <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html#party1999">very passionately
pro-EU</a> but over time, the doubts set in, especially after the crash
in 2008 and the EU’s harsh measures metered out to Greece.</p>
<p>As I started 2016, the doubts and problems with the EU had not yet
pushed me into the idea that the UK should ever leave the EU; I
started 2016 as a reluctant but firm ‘remanian’.</p>
<p>However, I wanted to make the decision based on all the information
and up to date arguments. I turned to other people, both on Twitter
and in the real world.</p>
<p>I soon ran into a problem, even discussing my own doubts was beyond
the pale with anyone pro-EU, you must support the EU because that is
what you do.</p>
<p>On Twitter it was worse, loudly unfollowed by 20-30 people, regularly
blocked in the middle of a seemingly civil discussion over a technical
EU matter.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/gollum.jpg" src="_images/gollum.jpg"/>
<p>I was shocked the first time, saddened the second time, third time it
was water off a duck’s back, I stopped noticing or caring when someone
threw their toys out of the pram.</p>
<p>I did try to carrying on to discuss with any remainian who wanted to,
in the hope they would come up with the magic argument that would put
me squarely back in the remain camp. It soon became apparent that
everyone else has the same doubts and concerns.</p>
<p>Unlike ten years ago where you could easily encounter British
Europhiles who wanted to join the Euro and the Schengen Area and so
on, now ardent Europhiles seem a bit thin on the ground.</p>
<p>I met no-one that had a positive view of the EU as a force that will
make things better, it was just what you did about the faults, whether
you just lived with them in a fatalistic fashion or tried to face up
to them by leaving (and potentially making a lot of new
issues/opportunities).</p>
<p>A lot of the remain argument was that uneducated and poor people want
to leave, so don’t be in that group since they are all racists and
bigots. Well I was brought up in very modest circumstances indeed and
these are my people and I don’t recognise that description.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the leavers were just more fun and upbeat people. They were
happy to listen, discuss and gently point out their views.</p>
<p>I guess the morals of the story are that if you want to campaign for
something, have the most hopeful message. Even if you are against
something, have the best plan for fixing or replacing or leaving it
behind. Blocking people doesn’t win votes in real elections.</p>
<p>Above all, the moral is Twitter is probably a crap place for
discussing politics.</p>

<p>The EEC was not very popular when the government took the UK into it in
1973 and so the government was forced by the voters to have its first
leaving referendum only two years later in 1975.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence1.jpg" src="_images/fence1.jpg"/>
<p>The government and all of the media threw the kitchen sink at remain in
and succeeded, but on practical grounds alone, it never even tried to
sell the vision of an ever closer union to the people of Britain, and
if it had, it would have been rejected.</p>
<p>While governments managed to resist another referendum for the next
four decades, the practical nature of the remain argument meant there
was no mandate for further integration, indeed the remain argument was
won precisely on the basis that Britain would not be pulled in any
deeper.</p>
<p>So as the EU project developed in different directions, Europe was not
something Britain did, Europe was something done to it; something that
had to resisted or opted-out of: Schengen Area, the Eurozone and
countless other programmes.</p>
<p>The 2016 EU referendum was the the last moment in history that a
pro-EU case could be credibly made but again the establishment decided
not to make it. It again decided to focus on the perceived practical
shortcomings of an independent UK.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence2.jpg" src="_images/fence2.jpg"/>
<p>In other countries, there are some people who genuinely believe in a
United States of Europe. However, <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">we in the UK never had that
tradition</a>, so those arguing for remain are those who benefit most
from the patronage that results from laundering our own taxes to and
from Brussels give.</p>
<p>Brussels is awash with lobbyists for non-European interests and
yesterdays winners struggling with technological change, wanting to
game the regulations against new interests.</p>
<p>Remain was a coalition between decent people wanting to keep the
status quo but also all these aforementioned parasites and spivs who
know they could not justify a policy or an item of government spending
to the British electorate so abuse the (still not very democratic) EU
to sidestep democracy to push their own special interests and
regulations.</p>
<p>I <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">said before the referendum</a> that the rationale for entering the EU
in 1973 was marginal at best and I concluded the forces moving the UK
away from it <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html#enter-the-matrix">were increasing</a>.</p>
<p>The neo-liberal/Thacherite consensus of the last 30 years cracked
fatally in the 2008 crash, since then it has been on life support as
near infinite supplies of money are printed and dished out to the
banks, but brain activity has not returned to the patient. The EU
referendum is the British people starting to turn the machine off.</p>
<p>To put it another way, as I said <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/750044741073592320">on Twitter</a>, it was Chekhov’s
referendum. David Cameron put a gun on stage and the people shot him
with it.</p>
<p>After the vote, I talked about the call for the second referendum and
<a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/25/this_is_my_design.html#second-referendum">why it will not work</a>, Brexit has just sped up the inevitable
changes.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence3.jpg" src="_images/fence3.jpg"/>
<p>Anyway Britain is leaving the EU. If you voted for remain, not only
will be much happier if you just accept it and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/zeth0/status/750323410979397632">move on with your life</a>,
you will be more successful. Escaping to a fantasyland where the vote
did not happen will mean you miss the opportunities of the future.</p>
<p>This applies to organisations and sections of the economy too, after
all no one is owed a living.</p>
<p>Those that work in harmony with the new independent era will thrive,
those that mope around re-fighting yesterday’s narrative will be seen
as irrelevant in the post-Brexit era and thus will lose funding
accordingly.</p>
<p>The leave supporting public has been gracious in victory, trying to
bring everyone on board. However, the good mood will not last long if
institutions are seen to be working against the UK. David Cameron and
George Osborne doubled-down on Remain and their position was untenable
in the new era. Those that don’t learn the lesson might suffer the
same fate.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/fence4.jpg" src="_images/fence4.jpg"/>
<p>I think in the long term, Brexit will be a benefit to all of Europe,
Britain has gone from being an unhappy tenant of the EU to Europe’s
most supportive neighbour and ally.</p>
<p>If you are a European, we the British people, voted to take by control
and run our country from Westminster and our city councils and
regional parliaments in the UK. However, we still love you as people
and we love your countries. We can still kiss you from over the fence.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/borisbus.jpg" src="_images/borisbus.jpg"/>
<p>The leave side had Boris’s battle bus which had the slogan “We send
the EU £350 million a week, let’s fund our NHS instead.”</p>
<p>While it is technically true that the cost of the UK’s soon to be
ended EU membership is £350 million per week, we got a rebate (i.e. a
discount) of £100 million so we only sent £250 million per week. While
it is not stated in the slogan how much exactly extra money could be
available for our NHS, it cannot be £350 million per week, since only
£250 million per week ever existed (to the extent that money exists).</p>
<p>For me, the question of whether to be in the EU or not was never about
money but the slogan would have worked as well with whatever the
correct fact-checked figure is.</p>
<p>However, if it was meant to be a trap, it worked. The remain side had
far more money and far more establishment figures, and when it
constantly sent those figures out to say that the real number is
really £250 million per week and some of this is spent on useful
things here in the UK etc, it is made leave’s case for it.</p>
<p>For £250 million a week is still a massive number and the same order
of magnitude, by focusing on the detail, Remain left the overall
premise unchallenged.</p>
<p>Having your opponents make a point for you, frees up your own
resources and own airtime for other points.</p>
<p>Not that it matters, as no one was listening. People voted for their
own reasons not because of anything Boris said.</p>

<img alt="../../../_images/design.png" src="_images/design.png"/>
<p>This is a sequel to the <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a> about Britain’s relationship with
the EU. That ended with the conclusion that “However, we will leave in
the end, it is just a matter of time, and we will not be the only
ones.”</p>
<p>Little did I know that the people of Britain were already there ahead
of me. When the BBC’s coverage started under Britain’s leading
presenter, the great David Dimbleby. It seemed that the Remain side
was going to cruise home.</p>
<p>I thought, okay a noble fight, we made a point, but the forces of
multi-national capitalism were overwhelming. So I went to bed. After
all the two campaigns were not equal.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-lop-sided-campaign">
<h2>A lop sided campaign</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/scales.png" src="_images/scales.png"/>
<p>The Remain side had all the forces of multi-national neo-liberal
capitalism, the banks, the European Commission as well as implicit
support from the supposedly independent Bank of England who popped up
occasionally with helpful statistics and reports.</p>
<p>A lot of people do their duty as citizens and vote, but are not really
interested in politics. They have enough on their plate with work and
family etc. These people were always likely to do what they were told
by the political leaders and also are biased towards the status quo.</p>
<p>The British government spent £9 million on posting a Remain booklet to
every house in the UK, a benefit that the Leave side did not get. We
also had the Prime Minister and the leadership of the other mainstream
parties like Labour, SNP and Greens supporting Remain.</p>
<p>The support of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was particularly
difficult as the traditional left wing position in Britain is to be
against the EU. The 1975 referendum, the No campaign was led by the
main Labour figures of the day Michael Foot, Tony Benn and Barbara
Castle.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/corbyn2.png" src="_images/corbyn2.png"/>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn was a well known eurosceptic but as the leader of the
Labour party, whose MPs were mostly elected during the Blair years and
thus are mostly right wing, he was in a bit of a difficult
situation. So he did his duty as party leader and represented the
party line, appearing at events all across the country for Remain.</p>
<p>He did however refuse to make any out and out lies, and so when
cornered with a particularly forensic question, the truthful answer
was not always the most politically helpful answer for the Remain
side.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/corbyn.png" src="_images/corbyn.png"/>
<p>The mainstream media were very pro-remain at first, especially the
publicly owned TV stations like the BBC and Channel 4, but the
newspapers started to drift away, even the Guardian started featuring
a few pro-leave articles in the last week or so of the campaign.</p>
<p>Moving from one newspaper to another is a matter of moving your hands
a few centimetres, so British newspapers do tend to reflect the views
of their readers to a certain extent, despite the owners tending to be
pro-Remain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-get-someone-out-of-bed">
<h2>How to get someone out of bed</h2>
<p>However, after a few hours of occasionally checking my phone in a
sleepy haze. Something was happening. Was I dreaming it?</p>
<p>Area after area went for Leave. London and its little spider legs of
wealth around London were going for Remain, as was Scotland, but the
rest of England and Wales mostly voted for Leave.</p>
<p>I decided to get back out of bed, go back downstairs and wait for the
Birmingham result.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="birmingham-is-for-leave">
<h2>Birmingham is for leave</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/selfridges.jpg" src="_images/selfridges.jpg"/>
<p>Britain’s second largest city, Birmingham is not some twee ancient
town like the nearby Anglo-Saxon capital of Tamworth (see last
post). Birmingham is a child of the industrial revolution and the
Empire (also see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a>) with the major expansion of the city in
the 1800s and early 1900s. Birmingham is a beautiful city, as long as
you like Brutalist and Modern architecture.</p>
<p>Birmingham is somewhere between 45% and 50% “White British” (this
weird term is the designation the government uses), it isn’t the most
diverse city, which is Leicester and some the cities of the North but
it is the one I live in and know best.</p>
<p>The different races of Birmingham mostly get on very well, the city’s
signature dish is the Balti and the civic institutions put on events
that reflect the city’s diverse cultural backgrounds but are open to
all.</p>
<p>It is a Labour city. The right wing parties barely make a foothold,
there is no UKIP presence to speak of. There are 9 Labour MPs and just
one Tory MP in the outer suburb town of Sutton Coldfield, which
doesn’t even consider itself part of Birmingham.</p>
<p>Birmingham with its 700,000 registered voters in the main city area,
was expected to be a big remain landslide. When the result came it was
50.1% for Leave.</p>
<p>When you go through the posher areas of Birmingham, there were loads
of Remain posters on many of the large expensive houses, so it is not
mathematically possible or likely that all the votes to Leave were
from “White British”. So the Black and Asian voters of Birmingham were
split in the same way as the white voters, or at least enough to put
Leave over the top.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-question-that-remain-will-never-answer">
<h2>The question that Remain will never answer</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/silence.jpg" src="_images/silence.jpg"/>
<p>I focused <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a> on the successful non-EU immigration that the UK
has had, and a good proportion of them seem to have gone for Leave, as
I thought they would. One of the questions I posed in my <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a> can
be summed up as follows:</p>
<p>Why should a Bulgarian be able to bring their family to the UK and
trade freely, but an immigrant from India cannot?</p>
<p>Despite being posed many times by Leave, this question was never
answered by the Remain side. Therefore, the Black and Asian vote split
and the Leave side benefited from a million or two more votes
nationally, which is of course a winning difference.</p>
<p>Why didn’t Remain field an answer? For four reasons I think.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="little-europeans">
<h2>Little Europeans</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/football.jpg" src="_images/football.jpg"/>
<p>Firstly, is the ‘little Europeans’ issue I talked about in the last
post, the culture of the EU is about middle class White-European
people flying about between cities on expenses. Britain has a
Commonwealth history making us look at the world, a lot of Europe does
not.</p>
<p>Those Britons most in support of Europe tend to have this identity
also. The idea that people from outside the EU such as Africans or
Indians are equal to Europeans, and therefore the system should
reflect that, just doesn’t occur to them while hidden inside the walls
of fortress Europe. We might as well be talking Klingon for all the
good it does. There is just not the mental framework there to get it.</p>
<p>Remain also just assumed that all non-“White British” were theirs by
right and they did not have to work for it. The idea that Asian or
Black voters would have independent ideas and issues that should be
considered did not seem to be considered by Remain.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Remain side I think made a tactical decision not to
answer the question. They thought saying something like immigration is
good, we should open our borders to the Commonwealth too, but we are
not going to control EU migration at all to compensate, would push
more people to the Leave side.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="top-down-remain-bottom-up-leave">
<h2>Top down Remain, bottom up Leave</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/george.jpg" src="_images/george.jpg"/>
<p>Thirdly, because the Remain side inherited the infrastructure of the
Labour and Tory parties, they followed a lot of top-down practices
that made sense in a constituency first-past the post based system. So
they sought to get a simple majority in each area, rather than
focusing on total number of votes. They assumed that most Midland and
Northern cities as well as Wales, would overall go for Remain so
didn’t put any real effort into those areas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Leave campaign, short of financial resources, had to run
a grass roots, bottom up campaign. They found out the questions
putting people off Leave and had to come up with some kind of answer
to the questions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several Unions like the RMT, ASLEF and BFAWU; left-wing
anti-establishment figures like George Galloway and Julian Assange, as
well as the socialist worker and many others, were rallying the
non-mainstream media, blogs, and social networks to the Leave side.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-brainwash-yourself">
<h2>How to brainwash yourself</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/godzilla.png" src="_images/godzilla.png"/>
<p>The forth reason is connected to the last part, and the most important
issue and this is a wider reason to why Remain lost. They believed
their own propaganda, they brainwashed themselves. Believing that
there were no valid reasons want Leave apart from to control
immigration, they didn’t field any answers to the questions being
raised.</p>
<p>Remain just focused on two messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Project Fear - leaving the EU would be the end of the world.  The
Chancellor George Osborne, previously featured on this blog, the one
that likes to take money from disabled people and give it as tax
breaks to billionaires; he made a much lampooned threat of an
emergency budget requiring massive tax rises and spending
cuts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was the even more preposterous argument that the UK
leaving the EU would be the end of peace in Europe. I don’t even
know what this means. Are Germany going to restart the blitz and
rain down bombs on our heads? Is the UK going to gather an army of
longbowmen and retake Agincourt? What a lot of utter nonsense.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Project Sneer - anyone who is for leaving the EU is a racist Nazi
who wants to round up immigrants and throw them into the
sea. Equally stupid. We will talk about this again shortly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While immigration was an issue of course, the Leave campaign also
focused on many issues that were not immigration including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TTIP which does actually include healthcare and results in the break
up of the NHS and private health insurance from American companies</li>
<li>The issue of little-Europeanism/racism we just talked about</li>
<li>The fortress Europe that makes it difficult to trade with non-EU
countries which are the growing part of the world.</li>
<li>The lack of democracy in the European institutions. Only the
Commission can introduce laws and repeal laws. The elected European
Parliament can just discuss them. It has about us much power as the
fantastic UK youth parliament where school children go into the
house of parliament and discuss laws.</li>
<li>The focus on complex regulations instead of Common Law</li>
<li>The economic and social punishment given by the EU to Greece (see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a>)</li>
<li>Unemployment levels on the Continent.</li>
<li>You could go on and on.</li>
<li>The way the EU’s Thatcherite policies help distort the allocation of
resources towards London and the Financial sector and away from
manufacturing and wider England.</li>
</ul>
<p>Birmingham is a traditional capital of manufacturing, and still has
the productive capacity hanging on for when Britain starts depending
on making and selling things, rather than relying on financial scams
for its national income.</p>
<p>I wonder if this had a lot to do with why Wales voted Leave. The EU is
keen to spend our money on museums, University buildings, and so
on. But anything that might give areas like Birmingham or Wales a
competitive manufacturing advantage is not allowed. Just look what
happened recently to the Port Talbot Steelworks, EU regulations
stopped the government from acting to save this vital national
resource from Chinese steel dumping; steel is the foundation of
national defence after all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="echo-chamber">
<h2>Echo chamber</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/brainwash.jpg" src="_images/brainwash.jpg"/>
<p>The Remain side acted like an echo chamber. Its core message of
sneering at everyone that is not an EU-supporting cultural liberal
from Cambridge or London cost it dearly. The remain side followed its
own supporters on social networks, it did not engage with the
non-mainstream media of right or left, it did not go out and listen to
people’s reasons for Leave and provide an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Therefore they lost.</p>
<p>Ignoring the merits of the argument for a moment, the Remain campaign,
despite every possible advantage, managed to misstep at every possible
moment. From Osborne’s terror budget to trying to make political
capital out of the tragic death of an MP, there was not much
self-awareness.</p>
<p>Piling on the war monger Tony Blair and everyone responsible for the
2008 crash did not improve their credibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consumers-in-denial">
<h2>Consumers in denial</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/consumer.png" src="_images/consumer.png"/>
<p>When the result came, many tears were cried and much gnashing of teeth
by Remain supporters.</p>
<p>Several days on, the vestiges of Remain support are still in full on
denial. By not listening to voters in England and Wales outside London
and its small tentacles into the home counties and the University
cities of Oxford and Cambridge, they were totally dumbfounded that the
country voted against them.</p>
<p>Democracy is not about ordering a policy like a pair of shoes from
Amazon. You have to listen, you have to engage, you have to convince
people that are not like yourself, you have to build a coalition of
support.</p>
<p>Mocking people and blocking people on Twitter does not constitute
productive debate. Calling people racists or stupid does not move them
into your camp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-referendum">
<h2>Second Referendum</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/fleshwound.jpg" src="_images/fleshwound.jpg"/>
<p>The biggest joke of all is the idea of a second referendum. The people
who did not and will not listen want to have another vote and
keep having them until they get the result they want.</p>
<p>The Leave side had to wait over 40 years for a referendum. The Remain
side want one tomorrow.</p>
<p>This will not work.</p>
<p>Firstly, this referendum was extremely expensive in staff costs, venue
costs and lost productivity as schools and other public buildings are
closed. All elections are expensive and take a long time to
organise. Being based on the popular vote, it is a bit more
complicated than the normal constituency system that we are geared up
for. Normally there are lots of safe seats that never change and have
massive winning margins that don’t really require much precision or
huge amounts of staff.</p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of advantages the remain side had will no longer exist:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>David Cameron quit and there will be no pro-remain Prime Minister
again leading the charge and offering potential promotions and
knighthoods etc for those on his/her side.</li>
<li>Everyone is knackered. Labour and the Unions spent all their
campaign budgets and desperately need to save cash, energy and
volunteers for the next set of local elections and a possible snap
general election. Campaigners from other institutions like NGOs and
companies need to go back to their real jobs.</li>
<li>Project Fear is over, the British public already voted out and are
no longer scared. Those who felt they had to ignore their heart will
not need to do so again.</li>
<li>Project Sneer is ineffective because anyone previously scared of
talking about being out for fear of being seen as a racist or UKIP
supporter, has nothing to fear as they are with the majority 52% and
rising.</li>
<li>Any new referendum will be from the outside. The status quo will be
for remain out. The only people still for out will be a coalition of
cultural liberals and dodgy bankers.</li>
<li>The EU has had enough of us. When they say Britain is toxic and
causes contagion, it means that other countries want the special
deals we have had like vetos, partial rebate, no Schengen, no
Euro. They think the sooner we nasty Island hobbits are at arms
length, the longer they can keep the EU from collapsing. They are
deluded of course, but that is a discussion for another post.</li>
<li>Events - lots of nasty crap is coming down the pipe for Europe, it
will look more unattractive as time goes on. Also other countries
may leave.</li>
<li>Demographics - Non-EU migrants have the highest birth rate. So as
the years go on, ignoring the world outside and the issues we talked
about above becomes more untenable.</li>
<li>No More Patronage - the UK will now need its own systems for funding
Universities, research, regional development, farming, etc. People
will adapt to them and will no longer feel tied to Europe by an
umbilical cord of funding.</li>
<li>Progressive policies - the UK will increasingly find solutions that
are not legal or tenable in the EU. Rail nationalisation, student
scholarships, NHS re-nationalisation and so on. Once setup, they
will act us as a permanent lock keeping us out of the EU.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we run the referendum again, it will just be embarrassing. Leave
will get 70%, or maybe much more, if we are already out then 80% or
90% I can totally believe. We need to save our fellow citizens from
self-harm and mental anguish and just say no to that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>This is my design</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/chickens.jpg" src="_images/chickens.jpg"/>
<p>I don’t deny that Leave vote had white bigots, but it also had
socialists (like me) and a good amount of BME population outside
London.</p>
<p>In any case, the past is the past, we are on the way out.</p>
<p>The far right bigots will get a shock when it finds that the
independent UK actually increases immigration as it booms free of the
EU. This time our immigration policy can be race and nationality
blind, allowing the whole world to come here on an equal basis,
especially the Commonwealth countries who sent 4 million of their
citizens to fight and die alongside us in World War II and whom we
have treated terribly since.</p>
<p>I love Europe, I just don’t like the centralised Roman Empire style
state (see <a class="reference external" href="https://zeth.net/2016/06/20/rome_vs_the_matrix.html">last post</a>). I want the UK to engage with the EU countries
on a bi-lateral basis, and on the level of people and companies, as a
real union of peoples, not a neoliberal cage where everything has to
go via a centralised Brussels bureaucracy. I also want the UK to lift
its eyes and interact with the wider world.</p>
<p>This is our chance to do things differently. As we replace EU run
areas with local ones, we can upgrade them with modern values and
technology.</p>
<p>Our farming and fishing policies can have the greatest environmental
standards in the world. We can finally ban battery chickens and give
incentives for Organic food. We can stop the nonsense of paying people
not to produce food and instead pay them to upgrade their animal
welfare and environmental standards.</p>
<p>Our research policy can focus on devolving funding to the Universities
themselves, trusting them to invest in long term research
projects. Get the professors back in the lab and the lecturers back in
the classroom, rather than making them spend all their time bidding
for short-term grants.</p>
<p>We can return to making and not depend on the financial scams for our
national income.</p>
<p>We can increase the minimum wage to a real living wage and thus
encourage the use of automation, machines and robots (see end of last
post).</p>
<p>The excuse in the past was that if we could not give our young people
full scholarships to University, because it would be untenable to
offer them to the whole EU. Now there is no excuse, we should give all
young people a scholarship so they begin their careers with skills and
knowledge not debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boris-britain">
<h2>Boris’ Britain</h2>
<img alt="../../../_images/debate.jpg" src="_images/debate.jpg"/>
<p>Birmingham’s own Giesla Stewart was the voice of reason in this
campaign and the official leader of the Leave campaign. Giesla had a
good campaign and did very well. However, the mainstream media only
wanted to show Boris.</p>
<p>I must admit Boris also had a good campaign. He didn’t make any gaffs
and he looked like a leader, he stood up and took the incoming flack
from Remain and effortlessly outflanked his Tory opponents by pivoting
to the left when required. He seemed very comfortable and
statesmanlike sharing cross-party platforms with Labour Leave figures
such as Gielsa, Kate Hoey and others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile David Cameron refused to debate his opponents and looked like he
was afraid. The remain side didn’t manage to combine the two campaigns
very well.</p>
<p>Boris is going to win the Tory leadership, it will probably seem like
a coronation, then he will try to bounce a snap election and get a
strong mandate and he may win.</p>
<p>The left need to stop moping over the UK’s European exit and unite or
Boris will get a landslide.</p>
<p>We can make the progressive case and win the next election. We can
stop Boris’s Britain and make Britain a progressive country once
again.</p>
